  <div class="entry-content"><p>Woke up really late again, and had a slow start and then a quick breakfast.  We decided the one big thing we wanted to get done was the Louvre so we headed over there.  Turns out the Louvre sucks, and the art there is terrible.  The Mona Lisa may be the worst painting I have ever seen.  However, I liked the Spanish painters the best, followed by the French, and the Italians the least.  I did like the really massive paintings as I think it&#8217;s impressive to be able to create something so large without getting lost in the details.  After the Louvre, we came back to the apt for naps and some snacks, Euchre, beers, and then out again.  We bailed on the electro dance party we were planning to attend due to a 30 Euro cover and decided to go to this favela chic place which definitely looked like a favela.  Pre favela we went to some super high end bar very similar to death and co in the east village.  Super expensive really really well made drinks, very LES styled insides and a pretty dapper bouncer.  After a few rounds there we headed to the favela place and we were really pumped but they assured us there was no way they would let in 4 dudes with no chicks.  So we headed to our plan B but were unable to find it.  Along the way we stopped for gyros and met two French girls on vacation in Paris.  They had some destination in mind and invited us to join but we all walked around aimlessly before finally finding it.  By the time we got there though, the place was pretty empty/weird scene, like 90 year old man with no shirt on weird, so we decided to bail and just get a decent night of sleep.

  <div class="entry-content"><p>Spent another long day walking around the city capped off by a visit to the Arc D&#8217;Triomphe.  Pretty amazing view format the top, 8 roads converging in a circle at the Arc.  Really great day of walking around and Russell explaining all this stuff going on.  Naps and then dinner with Leigh Russ me and Fo at some famous steak restaurant which is Peter Lugers style.  You just tell them how many people and they bring you steak and french fries in the most ludicrous steak sauce.  Everyone licked their plates clean.  Our waitress was this really sweet french woman who chatted with us all night and made jokes about the fact that i had hidden a wine bottle under the table for apres diner and forrest opened the coke she brought him with the wine opener we have been carrying around with us.  After dinner we met up with Jon Beardsley and some other girls who knew Emma Haberman from high school.  We went to some jesus bar which had religious paraphernalia all over the bar and looked like a frat basement with a bathroom with porn magazine cut outs all over the place.  It was a chill bar and we all just kicked it for a while and then decided to get some wine and head down to the water.  Somehow Russ had met some boxer who had fallen in love with him and legitimately would not go away, so he said we were all going home, and was planning on going with this guy, trying to ditch him at some point and then coming to find us.  Within like 5 minutes i get a call from Russ saying that this guy asked some guy for 3 Euro and when the guy said no and lightly pushed him away this guy smoked him in the face, the dudes face exploded, sirens started blaring and Russ ran away.  He met up with us on the banks of the Seine where we camped out and went through a few bottles of wine.  There seemed to be a bit of a party on the other side of the river so Russ and I went to check it out but it had slowly dispersed by the time we got there.  There was a high class party on a boat parked on the side of the river and we tried to sneak/talk our way in but there security guards didn&#8217;t think it was comical in the least and quickly escorted us back onto the shore.

  <div class="entry-content"><p>Woke up late and did a long walk towards Notre Dame and the little thing on the hill.  Notre Dame is pretty impressive as to be expected, and just in general the cities architecture is magnificent, never seen anything like it.  Around mid day my sickness really started to drain me so we sat down for a minute and then decided to take the metro to our destination.  We hopped out and climbed up a big hill and at the top got a pretty spectacular view of the city.  After that we headed home and took some naps before meeting up with Herbert and Meg for the Spain world cup game.  I was still so exhausted that I had to bail and go back to sleep and skipped dinner and then met up with them around midnight at some bars post dinner.  The 3 hour nap was necessary and I felt a million times better and we proceeded to crush some beers and shots and champagne at a Rugby bar as we ran into some of Russ&#8217; old friends who were Rugby players.  Then Herbert lost her necklace so Russ went to go look for it with her and we headed to some other bar that supposedly had a dance floor but it was literally all old dudes like 50&#8217;s and so we went back to the front and got 4 beers and 4 shots for 80 EURO!  After that we headed home.

  <div class="entry-content"><p>The girls came with us to Tivoli which was cool but a major rip off.  We did one ride which was basically swings that spin around a really tall pole which gives you an amazing view of Copenhagen, a truly beautiful city.  Other than that we chilled on the green, walked around and had some churros basically just killing time before we had to head to the airport for our flight to Paris.</p>

<p>Arrived late at night and all crashed at Leighs apt, walked down the street to grab a beer and sample the Paris night life in the square right down from Leigh&#8217;s apartment.  We then decided to walk towards Notre Dame and grab some wine and drink it by the Seine and Louvre.  Pretty chill evening and then Russ took me to his old neighborhood to show me the apt he and Suzie party used to live in.

  <div class="entry-content"><p>We roused slowly and made our way into town to get some sushi to see if we could start putting healthy things into our bodies and nurse them back to health.  After sushi, we did some laundry, went to the park for some wiffle ball, and generally just attempted to waste the day away.  Fo and Russ went to an internet cafe for coffee and catching up on &#8220;real life&#8221; while Emma and I went shopping in preparation for the nights bbq.  Pernille and Helene arrived around 7:30 and they cooked up some pesto pasta.  In addition we made peppers, salad, burgers, potato salad, and hot dogs.  A pretty epic feast.  Emmas rooftop is a luxury style with hardwood on the top running the length of the building along with wood tables and comfy chairs, lights and a propane grill.  It&#8217;s pretty baller and I&#8217;m pumped to make good use of it this summer.  Tine showed up late to the feast around 11 with one of her friends Tove and we played a game of pass the pigs, drank a few bottles of wine and headed into her bedroom for some boce, jack daniels, and general mischief.  Emma and I passed out early because we were both sick.

  <div class="entry-content"><p>I woke up Day 4 having lost my voice and having such severe pain in my throat that it felt like someone had put a hot poker down my throat, not sure how that happened.  The camp was an absolute disaster and everyone felt like death.  We decided to bail on Day 4 of the festival and just head home early.  After getting some breakfast and water in us though, we felt a little bit better and decided just to hang around and participate in the destruction.  All around us, the festival came apart.  At around 5am that morning the &#8220;animal camp&#8221; across the street from us had put on the theme from the lion king and massacred their camp before exiting.  We used the whiffle ball batt to swing at just about anything that might explode in an interesting fashion, mayonnaise, tennis balls, wine bags, beer cans, etc.  We were all in that delirious post 3 day binge still hungover and feeling a little crazy haze that you sometimes get.  It was a pretty awesome morning capped by filling 5 gallon freezing cold water jugs and dumping them on members of our campsite who had fallen asleep or were caught unaware.  No no one had the energy to attempt any of the concerts despite a pretty good lineup for the last day, so we all played wiffle ball, ran around a bit, and then headed out in the early afternoon.  The devastation at the festival was pretty amazing.</p>

<p>We made it back to Emma&#8217;s apartment a severely depleted crew and decided to go out for a quick bite.  I got pizza, and the rest of the crew got pasta from a new place that had opened up.  Everything was delightful and we made it back just as it started to get dark around 10:30PM.  We threw in wedding crashers and everyone passed out.

  <div class="entry-content"><p>Day 3 was more of the same.  Probably a noon wakeup, a little food, and then Kings of Convenience and Vampire Weekend.  Kings of Convenience was chill and we just sat in the grass at the back.  Vampire Weekend was really fun and somehow we lucked out and got right up at the front I think because we cut a ton of people who had been waiting in line.  After that we returned to camp for dinner and more wiffle ball.  Again we required a pull of scotch and bought 3 more cases of beer to start getting festive.  The American flag drew a lot of attention and a lot of Americans came by to take a few swings.  Met a bunch of cool people.<br/>
[youtube=http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bM9n3m79tg0]
The highlight was a sportscaster worthy grab that I made where I jumped in the air over this guy but sort of clipped him with my shoulder.  I barely grazed him but he honestly acted like I had punched him in the face.  I apologized profusely and he ended up giving US HIS CASE OF BEER.  Still unclear how that one worked itself out.  We were also able to watch football on a giant screen while we were playing which was cool.  After wiffle ball we headed back to the camp for more beer bowling.  We got a good crew together and all headed out to see Prodigy who was supposed to be epic.  However when we got there, it kind of blew.  So we stayed for about 20 minutes and then set out to cause trouble.  I think Russ and I lost everyone somehow so we went to buy a bottle of Jack and go on some missions.  We ended up meeting two Danish girls in the line for booze and ended up hanging out all night with them.  One of them spoke fluent French so of course Russell fell in love with her and at some point I lost them and went wandering by myself and ran into Forrest at some point.  There was some early morning dance party going on so we tried to get into that but it wasn&#8217;t really happening so we went and hung out at the DJ tent before crashing.<br/>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>We probably roused around 11AM and went to get food.  We all began to properly meet each other and all drew our spirit animals in marker on each other.  I was Sweden Shark, in honor of my favorite guy I met traveling, Forrest was Relaxing Giraffe, Emma&#8217;s was blobfish, Pernille was a Manatee, Tine was a Guinea Pig.  To get the day into gear Fo, Russ and Laessa (Pernille&#8217;s brother) went to play whiffle ball.  They brough the Scotch and beers and an American flag that we were wearing as a cape.   As people came to join the game for at bats, they were required to take a pull of scotch before their ups.  This was when we met this awesome German guy, Christoph.  Emma and I went to join them but couldn&#8217;t find them so instead went to the skate park which had dudes in wheelchairs (not handicapped) throwing each other off ramps.  When we returned to the camp Russ and Fo had made friends with the camp across the street from us (the Animal Camp) which was a bunch of hilarious characters, a bunch of Danes who all had animal costumes (Cockroach, Cats etc) and they were playing beer bowling where you have two chairs at one end and two at the other end facing each other at opposite ends of a &#8220;bowling lane&#8221;.  In between your chairs you have a beer can, and you roll a soccer ball at the other teams beer can.  There is a judge who is in charge of &#8220;punishing&#8221; people, which basically consists of handing out arbitrary beer penalties on a whim.<br/>

Leigh arrived from France to much fanfare at the camp and probably received a better reception than most of the rockstars on stage at the festival.  We were so pumped and he added some much needed energy to the camp.  He arrived just in time to see the nephew concert.  Nephew is a Danish rock band which started by some famous Danish comedian who decided he wanted to be in a band too.  I have never seen a crowd go so insane for a concert.  It&#8217;s kind of one of those things that&#8217;s a mix between national pride and love for the music.  The concert was by far the best I&#8217;ve ever been too, literally 60,000 screaming Danes going fucking apeshit for these guys.  We had a group of about 10 of us at the concert and we were just jumping around and screaming even though we couldn&#8217;t understand anything they were saying.  At the end of the concert they had some guest DJs who got lifted down and hung just above the stage by the giant crane.  People went crazy.  So funny that the best concert we went to we didn&#8217;t understand a word of.  After the concert we all went on various missions.  The four of us ended up at a Norwegian tent of about 15 people who were really chill.   One of us got naked in exchange for beers.  We sat and kicked it with them till about sunrise and then went to the DJ tent.  It was a camp that was set up like a house with a DJ booth cut into the front of the house.  They were a bunch of young Danes who were pretty chill and loved us New Yorkers.  After a long night we finally hit the sack.<br/>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>We rolled into Copenhagen at 6AM after a 6 hour flight to Iceland, and another 4.5 hour flight into Copenhagen.  Emma surprised us by meeting us in the airport which was pretty awesome.  We headed into Copenhagen to Ostebro where she lives to drop off our stuff.  Russ and Fo went to a cafe to get some breakfast and Emma and I chilled at her apartment.  Then we packed our stuff up and headed to the festival.  We took a train to Central Station and then another train to Roskilde.  The last train we took was super old and had spray paint all over it and looked like a party train.  We were probably the oldest people on the train.  We opened a bottle of Glenfiddich we had picked up at the duty free shop in JFK (crazy cheap) and started passing it around but surprisingly no one on the train wanted any.  What kind of 20 year olds don&#8217;t want to hit the bottle before a 4 day festival?  The mood in the train was strangely somber for being 5 minutes away from the festival and I started to get worried that it might not live up to expectations.  However, once inside the festival gates, we knew we were in the right place.</p>

<p>The festival grounds stretch honestly as far as the eye can see, and that&#8217;s just the West camp, there is a whole &#8216;nother larger camp, the East camp.  About 70,000 people camp out, and every campsite has a pavilion style tent provided by the festival.  The whole setup is remarkably orderly.  Everything is set up in a grid with walkways every 40 feet or so similar to manhattan city blocks.  We found our campsite, and met the girls and fellow Campsite mates we&#8217;d be crashing with.  There were 6 girls, and two guys, in addition to me Fo Russ and Leigh (who was to join us the next night).  We immediately started crushing beers and scotch and when we were sufficiently soused we hooked up the ghetto blaster with some old school rap tunes and started roaming the grounds.  Within about 30 minutes a group of Danish girls dressed up in Lederhosen requested to give me a sponge bath in one of those little kiddy pools.  Then they washed my hair.  Everyone was in tears laughing, and it was at this point any doubt that the festival would live up to it&#8217;s promise vanished.<br/>
[youtube=http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CLafBYaLCpk]
We met an Irish guy, Cormac, at the same campsite who was there just by himself who had just stumbled across the festival.  He left home at 13 and has been traveling ever since.  He was in jail for 2 years because he had walked into the wrong pub in London with an Irish football jersey on and got the shit beaten out of him.  When they finally let him up he grabbed the first barstool he could find and smashed it through a guys face.  I asked him if he would do it differently if he could go back in time, and he said nope, but if he could change it, he would have just run after he did it.  Fucking hilarious character.  He lives in Sweeden now with his pregnant girlfriend.</p>

<p>When Emma and Tine first explained Roskilde to me, I looked at the lineup and was so excited to see about 10-15 shows.  However they laughed and told me there was no way I&#8217;d want to go to all those shows, that Roskilde is about the people and the camping, the music is just sort of a distraction.  I thought they were idiots, and just didn&#8217;t understand how much I love music.  However, after being at Roskilde for a few hours you realize that you could care less whether you see even one show.  Overall, I made it to LCD Soundsystem, Vampire Weekend, Kings of Convenience, Florence and the Machine, and Nephew and I think that was it.</p>

<p>By the time Tine and I went to LCD Soundsystem, we were both thoroughly wasted.  We got to the show about 30 minutes after it started and it was PACKED.  However, Tine was in the zone, and was just touching people on the shoulder and whispering things in their ear, and the red seas would part, we literally made it to the front row from the back of a 5,000 person crowd.  I just held onto her hand and watched the magic happen.  When we finally got to the front we absolutely rocked out.  LCD killed it per usual.

 After the show we took as many pictures with the random people we met on the way back to the campsite.  The rest of the evening was relatively uneventful, although Forrest met two Sweedish girls and went to the Gorillaz concert with them, and I can&#8217;t remember where Russell went.  The other crazy thing about Roskilde is that it&#8217;s light till about midnight and then gets light again at like 4am.  So almost the entire time you are there it is light out.  The first night I think we hit the sack at about 4AM.
