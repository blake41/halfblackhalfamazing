Because I lost my license in Bali I've been carrying around my passport when I go to bars in Australia.  I ran into two Iraqi bouncers on Friday night who commented on my American passports.  "How do you think George Bush would feel if us two Iraqis killed this American" they mused aloud.  I gave a nervous laugh and tried to smile.  "Ahh we're just kidding", they said, "Fuck George Bush."

So glad to see that almost a year after Obama's election while traveling internationaly I can still bask in the warm glow of the 8 years of goodwill America gained in the international community under George Bush.  How long will it take us to right our wrongs in the eyes of the world?  Ever?
