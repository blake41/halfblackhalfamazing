Whenever I am with friends I feel like we celebrate and I am always in search of good toasts to say.  When I was in Hawaii they taught me “Okole Maluna” which literally means assholes up, but should translate as like Bottoms up.  As I travel I have been asking everyone to tell me how they say Cheers in their language.  So here you go

Austria: Proust! Pronounced like Proost
Holland: Proost!
Australia: Cheers Mate! The mate part is the key part here
Sweeden: Skoul! Pronounced like the Danish one but slightly different but I couldn’t hear the difference because they have vowels that we don’t.
Denmark: Skul! Pronounced like Skull
China: Gan Bei! Pronounced like G(a as in apple)n Bay
