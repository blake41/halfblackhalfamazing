I finally met up with the French girl I met on the bust to BA, Carmen.  We went to Thelonius jazz bar which was really nice.  It was only 20 peso cover and the bar had a really cool ambiance.  We grabbed some seats on the couch and settled in for a great night of Jazz.  We had a couple glasses of wine and my french started to get much better.  I had a great time hanging out with her and speaking French for the first time in ages.  Things were going really well and we went outside to have a cigarette.  I don't know about girls reading this, but I feel like as a guy you hit a point in a date where you're like things are going well, im going to kiss this girl, and you just know things are going to work out.  However, right about when I hit this point, this guy comes out, who she had introduced me to earlier, who starts being all touchy feely with her.  At this point I figure this must be her boyfriend and that things are NOT going to work out for me.  We went back inside and the bar emptied out and it was just sort of the friends of staff after hours crew and we opened a bottle of champagne and sat at the bar and hung out.  At this point I could ask her point blank if that was her boyfriend because he didn't know french and wouldn't know what I was saying.  She told me he was and that he was just being jealous, you know how Argentinian men are.  I told her I thought it was reasonable to be a bit jealous given that she brought another dude to his bar and was being really flirtatious with him.  Oh well, all in all it was a really fun night, despite finding out some bad information a little late in the game.[![](http://halfblackhalfamazing.files.wordpress.com/2010/01/img_1082.jpg)](http://halfblackhalfamazing.files.wordpress.com/2010/01/img_1082.jpg)
