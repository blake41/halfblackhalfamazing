I love spontaneity, serendipity, random connections, loose ties, risk, randomness.  Most people I know are significantly more risk averse than myself.  However, most people also seem to always be fascinated by my appetite for risk and say they wish they could x,y,z.  In the movie The Game, the company CRS basically plans a random series of events that is crazy and thrilling for someone whose life is as non random and structured as could possibly be.  Is there a business here?  Would people pay to be surprised?  How can we create more loose ties?  I love playing the role of the connector, putting people together and creating synergies and inspiring people.  There's something here I'm sure of it.  Thoughts friends?
