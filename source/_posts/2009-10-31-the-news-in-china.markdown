Iris told me that the news in China is pretty hilarious.  Its 30 minutes, and it airs every evening.  The first 10 minutes detail all the great things the government did that day.  The second 10 minutes detail how happy all the people in China are.  And the third 10 minutes show how much suffering and unhappiness there is in the Western world.
