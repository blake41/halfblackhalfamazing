Sydney is not a good place to go if you are looking for a crazy adventure.  The city is beautiful, and IMHO one of the best places to live.  The beaches are beautiful, the surf is good, and the city itself is vibrant and very accessible.  I think it’s a pretty good combination of everything I liked about living in Honolulu, and everything I like about New York.  While it isn’t the best at anything, it’s good at everything.

Unfortunately while I was in Sydney I was mostly here to work, get my Brazilian visa, and resolve my lost wallet crisis in Bali.  Despite my limited time to explore, I did get to do a few cool things in Sydney.  My roommate and a few of her friends took me kayaking in Rose Bay and we kayaked to some rocks where you can go cliff jumping.  The water is pretty icy cold as they are just finishing winter, but it was a beautiful 30 degree celcius day out and it was fun despite the cold water.  A good friend of mine from Hawaii also took me to one of her kickboxing classes.  If you’ve never done kickboxing before, you should definitely try it.  It’s both an awesome workout, and so much fun.  They had a great mix they played while you are doing it, finishing off with the Mortal Kombat song which got me so fired up.

All in all Sydney was a good experience, but by the time my time here was almost up, I was pretty ready to leave.  Sydney is great, but outside of the funny way people talk, and driving on the wrong side of the road, you forget you’re even “travelling.”  You feel like you are in any American city.  I know I’m going to get torn apart by all the people who love Australia, so I want to qualify this with the fact that I love Sydney, it’s just not that much different than America, and when it’s bookended by Bali and Thailand, it kind of pales in comparison as far as the foreignness and the magic of being in a new place.  I’d love to get back to Australia at some point to see the great barrier reef, do some surfing when it’s warmer, and explore more of the natural beauty of the country.
