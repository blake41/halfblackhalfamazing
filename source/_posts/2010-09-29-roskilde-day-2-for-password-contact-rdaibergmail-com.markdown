Russell was totally blacked out by the time I joined the game, and I told him to go to bed to get some sleep since Leigh would be arriving later that night and I didn't want him to die.  After playing the game for a while and letting Russ sleep for a few hours, we decided we had to start waking him up in anticipation of Leigh's arrival.  Russell was literally comatose, and we tried everything to wake him up.  While he was sleeping we put a sign on Russ that said "Please Don't Fuck Me -Russell".  Finally I told Emma to try and rouse him by grabbing his dick and giving it a little massage but even that didn't even register, he didn't move in the slightest.  So then we got a big 5 gallon jug of water and slowly started pouring the freezing cold water on his head.  He slowly roused before finally trying to get up and stumbling around the campsite (see video) before crashing back onto his bead.  Everyone screamed NOOO and so we restarted the water on head method.  Finally we roused him and he started shivering like he was just swimming in the arctic so I took off his shirt, traded with mine, and put my fleece and shell on him and tried to warm him up.  After about 10 minutes he started showing some signs of life and slowly came back from the death just in time for Leigh's arrival.
