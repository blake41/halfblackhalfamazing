Met some kids at the hostel, British guy, Irish guy, British girl, a German guy, an Aussie couple and we all headed to get dinner at a restaurant called Suca La Vida that was all you can eat for 70 pesos including a bottle of wine and dessert.  Pretty amazing deal.  They have a giant grill with tons of cuts of meats grilling and you just point and whatever you want and they cut you off a slice of it.  They also have a ridiculous salad bar if you're into that sort of thing, which I am not.  After dinner I came back and ran into the Canadian guys I had kicked it with the other night and they were drinking screwdrivers in their room with some Aussie girls and listening to music so I partied with them for a bit before doing a 6AM breakfast run to a restaurant across from the hostel.  There were all these old women there (like 50's) who were not attractive in the least and we found out that they are prostitutes.  So bizzare.  

The next day I did a walking tour of la recolleta which is a wealthy part of the city and has an absolutely amazing cemetary.  Everything in the cemetery is mausoleums, and it's where Evita is buried.  I found out that all education in  BA is free including grad school.  This obviously creates problems as you have more students that want to go than you have space, and there's really corrupt government involvement in the schools as they take more than half of the taxes that are supposed to go to schools and line their pockets.  The girl who led the tours name was Heidy, half german, half Argentine, and 100% gorgeous.  I'm in love even though she's already taken.[gallery orderby="title"]
