Thought I would note this since it's been such a big help recently.  For anyone traveling internationally, check onetravel.com.  For some reason they seem to have way better deals/flights internationally than kayak which I had been using up until now.  Also, Airasia.com is great for southeast asia travel.  Their travel hubs are bangkok and kuala lumpur and you can pretty much get around anywhere from those spots for 100 or less each way.
