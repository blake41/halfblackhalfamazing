Probably the 1 thing you hear when you are in a hostel in Buenos Aires is that you HAVE to hit up La Bomba.  It's a drum performance held in an old warehouse every Monday night. La Bomba not only lives up to its insane hype, it dramatically surpasses it.  The venue itself is really cool.  Picture some abandoned warehouse in Williamsburg with a big stage and video screen on the wall.  There's probably a thousand people there.  From 7-8 the amateur drummers are on stage warming up the crowd.  It turns out it was the same crew we saw in the street the night before.  Then the real guys come out at 8 and everyone goes nuts.  I was worried when they first started that none of the tourists would get into it and dance.  However a few songs into the performance everyone was swaying and it turned into a full blown mad dance party.  These girls near me started a little circle and were pulling people into the middle and we were all dancing and getting crazy and shirts came off, beers were spilling everywhere.  It's just so f*cking awesome.[gallery orderby="title"]  [youtube=http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nfXnyS-kutQ]
