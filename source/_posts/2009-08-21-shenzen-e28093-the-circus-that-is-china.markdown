Whenever Porter would email me from China he would end with, “You have to come see the circus that is China.”  I always assumed this was Porter being Porter, but he was for real.  The dichotomy between Hong Kong and China is quite stark and remarkable.  Hong Kong was a truly international city where everyone spoke English and was incredibly nice and helpful.  The minute you cross the border into China no one speaks English and can’t be bothered to help you find anything.  We also were tricked by a man dressed like a policeman who derailed us from finding our train in order to sell us a bus ticket or a restaurant or something that was unclear.  By the time we figured out where to buy our tickets for the train they were sold out.  We had been travelling for about 2 hours at this point and were pretty frazzled and Leigh and I nearly freaked out.  I learned a lesson a long time ago when I lost my backpack in Cancun and spent the day trying to find it missing out on a great booze cruise instead of just accepting the loss and moving on.  So we decided to go to the Shangri-La Shenzen hotel (a 5 star hotel) and grab a quick drink to chill out, get wireless and make a plan.  The options were either to rush to the airport and try and get a plane to Guilin, or stay in Shenzen for the night and catch a 9am flight to Guilin.  We decided to get a hotel (a pretty surprisingly baller room at the Best Western) and catch the early flight.  This was by far the best decision of the trip so far.  I was exhausted so I took a nap while Leigh walked around a little bit.  Around 11 he returned to the room with two 22 ounce beers purchased for 9 Yuan (around  1.50 USD) and told me the city looked crazy and we HAD to go out.  I jumped in the shower, we downed the beers and asked the concierge where the hot spot was.  We hopped in a cab over to Soho Bar.  We were told that the club was full but if we bought a table for 600 Yuan we could go in.  The table did not come with a bottle so we went next door to Milk Bar.  At Milk Bar it is bottle service only meaning everyone has a table and everyone has to buy a bottle.  A bottle was 600 Yuan and we got Chivas Regal.  The bar is set up with long skinny tables that you stand at with a group at each spot (usually like a few guys and girls per bottle) along the table.  Each group gets their own bartender and whatever mixers they want to go with their bottle.  The hostess was really cool and explained to us how everything worked and I immediately fell in love with her.  The craziest thing about Milk Bar was that all the music was American Rap music, think Biggie, 2 Pac, Kanye etc.  So everyone is dancing and what not to the music but not one person in the club spoke English so no one had any idea what the music was saying.  Leigh and I just took it all in for a few hours and then Milk Bar started to really pick up.  The girls in the bar were all pretty unbelievable smokeshows.  Once we got a little liquid courage under our belts I used one of my standard break the ice moves and asked a cute girl in a white dress to take a picture of me and Leigh.  Leigh then started flirting with her which was pretty impressive given that she didn’t speak English and he doesn’t speak Chinese.  I guess the language of love is universal.  Leigh fell in love immediately.  She then introduced us to the club owner, Jerry, who was the man.  He brought us another bottle of Cheval on him and told us whatever we wanted was on him for the rest of the night.  He then introduced us to his sister and her friend and told them to take care of us and introduce us to some girls.  Jerry spoke really good English and was about 25-30 and clearly the man in Shenzen.  Jerry got us a bottle of champagne which comes in a bucket of ice with fireworks shooting out of it.  It was awesome.  By this point Leigh and I were pretty far gone and we were unabashedly hitting on every girl in the bar, literally dominating the scene.  They had girls who came around with suitcases filled with cigarettes and cigars which we smoked as if we were ballers in some movie.  Jerry introduced us to the DJ who was an incredible DJ as well as his brother and pretty much pimped us out all night.  I fell in love with some girl in a blue dress but have no memory of any of this.  Leigh says we were both spitting hot fire but I have no recollection and neither of us left with a girl.  He says that the girls were very traditional and it was not the sort of scene where you could get a girl to go home with you.  I like this explanation much better than maybe my Chinese game is not as honed as I think it is.  We headed back to the hotel and went to the Spa which is open 24 hours.  We got massages from two cute Chinese girls.  We got a 2 hour massage and I spent about two hours trying to convince my girl to go back to my room with me but she kept motioning to the window in the door I think trying to convey that her boss was watching.  She did give me a kiss which I consider a victory.  She also called a prostitute to come take care of me because she could not.  After our two hour massage we got foot massages.  About 30 minutes into the foot massage the prostitute my massage therapist called showed up in a tight silver dress and was obscenely hot.  She also had a hotel badge on meaning she worked for the hotel which I think is hilarious, and Leigh was terrified.  I explained the miscommunication that I was only interested in my massage therapist and did not want to pay for sex and she left.  At about 630AM we finally called it a night.  I gave a 200 Yuan tip to my massage therapist on a 350 Yuan massage and a 100 Yuan tip to the guy who brought me my clothes.  Then we went back to our room, packed up our stuff and got in a cab to the airport.  Definitely top 3 craziest/best/most fun nights of my life.

Update: Leigh says I tried to convince our massage therapists to come with us to Guilin and offered to buy them a hotel room and plane tickets.
