For me the last few days in Floripa went out without a bang.  The rest of the crew went out to Pacha on Saturday night for the biggest night of the week but I didn’t have the funds to join.  Pacha is well known for being the club of clubs down here and is not cheap.  The guys got VIP bottle service for about 300 Reias per person and said the club had about 3,000 people in it and truly blew away all expectations.  Supposedly the girls there were even more ridiculous than the ones we saw at the other clubs and daily at the beach.  One of the guys brought home a pretty hot Brasileira around 7AM when everyone got home and whose dad came to pick her up the next day when we all got up…
Other highlights included going to Praia Joaquina to do sandboarding which was cool to do once but not nearly as cool as I think it could have been.  The boards look like snowboards but don’t edge like snowboards do on snow or wakeboards on water.  Unfortunately you basically can’t turn at all because the rails just sort of catch the sand and dump you on your face.  Despite that, it was fun to mess around a bit although after a few runs you are dripping with sweat and utterly exhausted from the walk back up the dunes.  I imagine sandboarding in a desert in huge dunes where you can just bomb straight down would be cooler, or if you had boards with a design that looked more like a surfboard the experience would be much better.  Also, Grant and Jeb made an awesome Thanksgiving dinner which was nice because spending thanksgiving alone would have been tough.  We grilled up a bunch of sausage and beef with grilled onions on big skewers in a sweet hearth oven we had in the house and had a bunch of beers.  Other than that the week was all about relaxing at the beach, reading, and staring at nearly naked girls.
