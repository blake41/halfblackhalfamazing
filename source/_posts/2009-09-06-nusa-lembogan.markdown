We got up at 6 AM to watch the sunset from the top of the boat and it did not disappoint.  It was pretty incredible to be on a boat in the middle of the ocean with 4 great friends watching the sunset from the top of a pirate ship.  We arrived at Nusa not much after the sunset, and had another fantastic meal courtesy of Joseph.  We took the dinghy to shore and looked into surfboard rentals.  The waves were on the small side, so I grabbed an 8 foot longboard, which they call a Malibu on Nusa (which I love and am bringing back to the states).  Lonely Planet described Nusa Lembogan as the Bali many expect to find but never do.  I’m not sure I would agree with that assessment.  There weren’t really many beaches, and the island itself was not particularly pretty.  We decided just to stay for the day and take the boat to Bali overnight.  Our crew took us over to a break called shipwrecks, which is a hollow right and the sets were about 6 feet.  We all had a pretty tough day as the wave was pretty steep, we had long boards, and the crowd was not particularly friendly.
