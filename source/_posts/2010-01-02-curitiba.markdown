After Sao Paulo Suraj took off for Floripa, and Herbert and I headed to Curitiba.  I'm not really going to say much about Curitiba because we basically didn't do anything.  We had planned to drive to Parana (a beautiful national park area in Brazil) but due to complications with her work schedule we couldn't work it out.  On the whole Curitiba was relaxing, a really nice city to live and work in.  Very suburban.[gallery]
