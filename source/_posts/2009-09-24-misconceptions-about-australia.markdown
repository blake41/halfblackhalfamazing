After living in Hawaii for two years I subconsciously developed a pretty well defined idea in my head of what Australia, and all Aussie’s were like.  It wasn’t until I stepped off the plane in Sydney that it even dawned on me that I had all sorts of preconceived notions about what it would be like.  I walked up to the money changer and she was an Indian girl with an English accent.  My mouth dropped and I had to refrain from asking her who she was and what she was doing in Australia.  It’s kind of funny that you can have such a well defined idea about a place totally subconsciously and not even know you think that until you are faced with the fact that it is not what you thought it would be like.  When I got to China I expected it to be all Chinese people, which it was, but it didn’t occur to me that I already had a picture of what it would be like because it WAS what I thought it would be like.  It never occurred to me Australia would look more or less like the US demographically.

Secondly, 24 million people in a country larger than the US.  Please tell me I am not alone on this number being way lower than I had envisioned.  I had mentally assumed something in the realm of 100+ million.
