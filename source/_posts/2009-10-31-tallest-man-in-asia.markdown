I just wanted to note that it has felt so great being the tallest person everywhere I go.  When I get on a subway, I’m at least a head taller than just about everyone on the train.  It makes me feel like a giant badass.  Just wanted to share that.  If you’re a short guy, come to China/Japan and feel like a baller.

The negative to this is all doorways are built like 6 inches to a foot shorter.  I've banged my head an innumerable amount of times.  You'd think you'd adjust to it, but you'd be wrong.
