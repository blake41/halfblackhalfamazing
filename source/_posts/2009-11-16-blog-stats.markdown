In celebration of my blog getting it's four thousandth hit since inception, I'd like to share some of the stats with you as it's told me a lot about my readers and what they find interesting.  

I've written 96 posts since I left on August 13th.

The blogs busiest day was the day the post went up about randomly running into Webb in Laos.  The blog got 329 hits that day.

The top pictures are ones of me with girls, me out partying, and me with Webb.  So basically my audience is the same one that reads People magazine and Gawker.
