Woke up early to do the Campuan Ridge hike which takes you north through the village  of Pagoya and back to town.  I was hoping this hike would be a little more rugged, but it ended up being more of a stroll down some streets through a town.  There were a few parts that went through some beautiful rice paddies but for the most part I was a bit disappointed.  Nothing like Hong Kong or China.  After the hike we stopped at the Fly Café which had amazing food.  I had some killer key lime pie, caramel pancakes and pepperoni pizza.  After that Mike and I went on an epic search for acupuncture as I had seen brochures for it and had always wanted to try it and Mike’s stomach had been hurting him for days.  Unfortunately we confused acupressure massage with acupuncture and ran around to every spa in Ubud before we realized our mistake.  Finally we found an alternative medicine clinic who did acupuncture.  It was a pretty cool experience.  I didn’t have any particular ailments I wanted treated other than a sore lower back and neck so she gave me the acupuncture to restore energy and get your chi flowing correctly.  I was curious whether or not the needles would hurt and they definitely did a little bit but not too bad.  I got one in the heel, knee, stomach, wrist and elbow on both left and right of my front side, and you sit for 15 minutes while they work.  You can definitely feel the blood coursing through your body during this time and it feels pretty cool.  Mike got like 20 needles in his stomach which was pretty hilarious.  Then we turned over and I got about 6 in my neck, 10 in the lower back and one behind each knee.  The back needles felt really good, and by the end I had almost fallen asleep I was so relaxed.  After Acupuncture I headed out to get a back neck and shoulder massage at Eve Spa which was delightful and cost 5 USD.  Adam and I headed to do a meditation class at 6 but the head guy was headed to some event and class was closed that night.  We headed over to the Yoga House to see if we could do a Yoga class but we had just missed the class and the only thing left was a class called “Just Dance” a two hour unled improvisational dance.  Not exactly what I had in mind for my man date.    We headed over to the Jazz Café which was the highlight of my stay in Ubud.  They had live Jazz and raised seating overlooking the band but you sat on the floor on pillows against the wall.  It was a gorgeous open air setup with pictures of famous jazz musicians all along the walls.  The band was 4 Balinesian guys and started off with a little Eric Clapton.  They played covers all night and the lead singer had an incredible voice which sounded just like BB King.  It was pretty cool to see that voice coming out of this tiny Balinesian man.  Dinner was spectacular, by far the best food we’ve had in Bali.  I had Chicken stuffed with feta cheese and sundried tomatoes, and we got bruschetta, bread with feta cheese butter dip, calamari, and Balinese chili dip with bread.  We added a couple beers to dinner and it was about all you can ask for a meal.  Cost: 20 USD per person.
