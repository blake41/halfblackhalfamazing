The girls came with us to Tivoli which was cool but a major rip off.  We did one ride which was basically swings that spin around a really tall pole which gives you an amazing view of Copenhagen, a truly beautiful city.  Other than that we chilled on the green, walked around and had some churros basically just killing time before we had to head to the airport for our flight to Paris.



Arrived late at night and all crashed at Leighs apt, walked down the street to grab a beer and sample the Paris night life in the square right down from Leigh's apartment.  We then decided to walk towards Notre Dame and grab some wine and drink it by the Seine and Louvre.  Pretty chill evening and then Russ took me to his old neighborhood to show me the apt he and Suzie party used to live in.
