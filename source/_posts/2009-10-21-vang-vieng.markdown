After 3 days in Luang Prabang we were ready to take off so we returned the bikes, checked out of our hotel and grabbed breakfast.  Sweeden insisted that we should take the local bus despite the lack or air conditioning so we headed to the South Bus Station.  Unfortunately they wouldn’t sell us local bus tickets, they insisted they only had VIP bus (the tourist bus) that cost 3 times as much.  So we decided to just start hiking south and try and hop on the local bus when it came by and get a ticket once on it.  I really had just wanted to take a minibus together but didn’t care enough to argue.  When none of this really panned out we flagged down a minibus and bartered with him till we got a 90,000 kip per person rate and we hopped in for a white knuckle five hour ride to Vang Vieng.  This ride was both the most beautiful and scariest ride I’ve ever been on.  You are rigint through the mountains on these incredibly narrow windy roads with a driver going way faster than he should narrowly missing traffic going the other way.  I couldn’t relax the whole time, but the scenery was well worth the craziness.  Arriving in Vang Vieng very soon.

If you ever go to Northern Thailand, and Laos, I recommend doing a trek, taking a minibus to Chiang Kong and the slow boat to Pak Bang/Luang Prabang.  You will meet so many awesome people and it is so easy and such a great time.
