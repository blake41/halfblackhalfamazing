I Found out that one of my good friends from Hawaii, Nana, was back in Sydney.  She invited me to join her for the Katchafire concert on Friday at the Cogee Bay Hotel.  It was a pretty amazing offer considering that Katchafire is probably one of my favorite bands of all time.  They are a Maori band from New Zealand and massively popular in Hawaii and I'd been dying to see them ever since I first heard them covered live at my favorite bar in the world, Mai Tais in Hawaii.  

The concert was definitely one of, if not the best, I've ever been to.  The venue was tiny, maybe a couple hundred people, and the crowd was pumped.  Everyone there were clearly huge fans as we all knew the words and were singing along with the band and skanking our faces off.  The whole scene was just a super fun positive vibe, and the two girls I went with, Nana and her friend Ches were great company.
