One of the guys I was travelling with, Sweeden, told me the funniest story I have heard in a long time.  He had been travelling with an Australian for about three months, through China and the Phillipines and finally Thailand before he met up with us on the border of Laos.  So he tells us this story about Ko Pan’Ang where they went out for a typical crazy night out there.  They return at like 3PM the following day, drunk out of their minds, on the back of scooters, with chicks driving them.  This is the last thing Sweeden remembers before complete blackout.  He meets up with his buddy much later that night, and his buddy is not speaking, and looks really morose.  He asks him what’s wrong and his buddy answers, “I fucked a man last night.” To which of course Sweeden wants to know if there’s some story, which of course there is.  He says he went home with this “chick” and “she” started giving him this fantastic blowjob.  After a while “she” tells him “she” wants him to fuck “her” doggystyle in the ass.  Which of course is unorthodox, but not unheard of.  So he’s banging her in the ass for a while and he reaches around front to give her vagina a little massage, at which point he finds two tiny balls, no penis though.  At this point it’s clear to him that he is boning a man, but he is about 80% of the way done, he figures he might as well finish the job.  So he does, and then he goes home and hangs his head in shame.  Thank you Sweeden.
