There was an amazing amount of outdoorsy stuff to do in Mendoza, and most of it pretty cheap, but I only had $1000 USD until I could get back to the states and get another debit card, so I was trying to be extremely conservative.  The cheapest/best thing I heard about was called the high Andes tour.  A bus came and picked us up at 7AM and took us on a tour up to the top of the Andes/Chile border for 100 pesos.  Mel came with me and it was an awesome day.  We stopped at a lot of lame little touristsy spots along the way and they let us get out and take pics, but nothing really compared to going 3000 meters up the mountain in a van and getting up to the top of the mountains and the Chilean border.  It was unbelievably cold, which makes sense because we were so high, but I had no warm clothes with me.  We go to run around a bit and snap pics and then we headed down to the base camp for an amazing meal.  Mel and I had bought a bottle of wine earlier and cracked that as well as a huge tray of meat and stews and various Argentinian dishes.  It was a delightful way to end the day and we headed home with bellies full and smiles on our faces.

After we got home Charles and I decided to make dinner for everyone so we headed to the supermarket and got ingredients for some kind of pasta dish he wanted to cook, got some Quilmes beer and some crazy cheap Malbec and cooked up a fine meal for our friends in the hostel.  We had another great night of cards and beers and hit the sack early.  [gallery]
