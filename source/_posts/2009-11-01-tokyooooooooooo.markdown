Windows update automatically updated my computer and did a restart which meant that alarmclock.com was no longer on, so my alarm never went off.  Luckily, I woke up at 6:30 AM.  How my body knew to only sleep for 3.5 hours when it was totally wasted from the day before is beyond me.  I grabbed my stuff, checked out as quickly as possible and hopped in a cab to the airport and told the driver to step on it.  This time when I got to the airport, rather than patiently waiting, I ran to the front of a line and asked if I could still get on my flight.  Luckily the taxi ride to the airport was only about 30 minutes instead of the hour I had been told.  So I made my flight with about 15 minutes to spare.  So lucky.  I think if I had missed that flight, I would have just had to give up on this whole trip and go home.  I really think it would have broken my spirit.  The highlight of the day was an incredible sunrise where the sun just appeared as a golden ball on the horizon.  Don't think I've ever really seen the sun rise like that, must be the smog or something.[![IMG_0585](http://halfblackhalfamazing.files.wordpress.com/2009/10/img_05851.jpg)](http://halfblackhalfamazing.wordpress.com/2009/11/01/tokyooooooooooo/img_0585-2/)

I checked into a hostel as Tokyo is crazy expensive for hotels and I figured it'd make it easier to meet people.  Although update:everyone at this hostel is really unfriendly.  I have not met one person yet.  Anyways, I was so exhausted that I just grabbed a bite to eat and hit the sack despite really wanting to go out on a Friday night in Tokyo.[gallery]
