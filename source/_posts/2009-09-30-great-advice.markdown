"Whatever happens, by the nature of simple probability it probably wonâ€™t be the worst thing that has ever happened to you or will happen to you."

"We never know it at the time, but you might be living the defining moment of your life right now. What would you do if it was?"

These two quotes I discovered on Taylor Davidson's blog which I discovered in my search on the internet of people doing similar things to myself.  http://www.taylordavidson.com/writing/trip-2009/

I liked them so much I just had to share.  The first has been my mantra ever since losing my backpack in cancun with wallet and other various important items.  I lost my wallet in Bali a few weeks ago and didn't even blink an eye.  Shit happens.  It's almost certainly not the worst thing thats ever happened to you and there's probably something worse happening to someone else at that exact moment.  Don't sweat the small stuff, and even the stuff that seems major, probably isn't in the context of your life.  

The second I thought was great because everybody knows carpe diem, but this seems to be the question begged by carpe diem.  Assuming there was something to be seized right now, what would it be? Then go seize it!  As we say in Fort Greene, get after it.
