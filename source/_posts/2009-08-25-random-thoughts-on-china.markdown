The first thing you are struck by in China is the lack of any sort of rules of the road.  Thousands of people on mopeds, few traffic lights, and passing whenever you want.  Ironically China is supposed to be repressive compared to America but the actual day to day lives of most people here seem to be bound by significantly less rules and structure than it is in America.  I wonder if Chinese immigrants feel that America has a significantly more controlling government than China?

When I went to write some blog posts from China I couldn’t figure out why the internet wasn’t working when I tried to connect to my blog site.  It finally dawned on me that there is no free speech in China and that facebook, tumblr, and wordpress were all blocked.  The concept of the internet being restricted had, until then been a relatively surreal concept that I knew existed but didn’t seem real.  It was pretty wild to experience this lack of access firsthand.

Changing money in China is absurd.  You can only change money at the Bank of China, not to be confused with the Agricultural Bank of China or the Commercial Bank of China nor the Industrial Bank of China.

Taxi drivers hate using their meters and literally will laugh at you if you ask or suggest that they turn it on and will not take you.

The culture of haggling over almost all prices gets to be quite tiresome.  Always wondering if you are getting a fair or good price becomes stressful.  It also often seems silly when you realize that you are haggling over a dollar or two that you wouldn’t think twice about spending in NYC.  I wonder if your average street vendor or person selling service in China to residents or tourists would be better served to just post a higher price and have everyone pay a high fixed posted price rather than trying to screw a couple people and have the majority of people bargaining the price down.

It was interesting to talk to fellow travelers about their experience in travelling in China.  Everyone I talked to felt that China was a very difficult place to travel and very unwelcoming to foreigners.  My initial reaction when I got to China was such but I tried to overlook this so as not to be the arrogant American who expects everyone to know English.  However, it seemed like no matter what country people were travelling from, they all knew English, and expected the Chinese would as well.

People didn’t seem to know street addresses in Guilin.  It’s still unclear to me how this is possible.

After our experiences in Hong Kong, Guilin, Shenzen, and Yangshuo, I’d love to see what a big international city like Beijing or Shanghai is like.  Are they more similar to Hong Kong or Shenzen?

Living in NYC and having gone to Dartmouth makes you feel very wise, cosmopolitan and worldly, yet being in china for a week has never made me feel more ignorant.  Until a week ago I did not know Hong Kong and Macau were not part of China.  I didn’t know that Hong  Kong was a British Colony until their 100 year lease expired in 1997.  I didn’t realize how big cities were in China.  I expected Shenzen and Guilin to be rural china, but they are massive very modern cities significantly larger than Boston.   I don’t know a thing about how China’s communist gov’t really works, or how they actively manage the economy.  Shenzen has 8 million people! Have any of you ever heard of it?

As China continues to grow and develop, they have the opportunity to create their country however they want, using the lessons of the great civilizations and cities that have evolved since the industrial revolution.  Will they surpass all other great cities by learning from the mistakes of others and building infrastructure from scratch rather than trying to evolve broken systems already in place?

Everyone in China seems to be a hustler.  Wherever you go people are moving, selling, working.  I wonder if this is a cultural phenomenon or the inevitable product of 1.3 billion people competing for scarce resources?

The ability these days to travel with a netbook and almost no planning is remarkable.  Everyone should get one of these for travel as well as a kindle.  I can’t get over how awesome both have been.  Every place we go has wireless and we sit down, grab a beer and make a plan for the next day, looking up hotel reviews, things to see, places to eat, and within 30 minutes have synthesized the collective knowledge of millions of travelers into a place to stay and a plan to optimize our stay in each place.  Netbooks give you the ability to deviate from a plan in seconds.  I love being able to stay in touch with people via gchat and this blog rather than the phone.  The experience of travelling will be better because of this shift.

One of the more interesting things I’ve noticed about travelling in India and China is the relationship of males and females in the society.  The vast majority of hospitality staff (stewardess, front desk at hotels) are female, pretty, young, and extremely friendly.  Their truly is a sense that they are there to serve you and happy to make your experience better.  This seems to stem from the historical male/female power dynamic where a woman’s job is to serve her husband.  As the son of a progressive feminist mother it is strange to travel in a place and observe this phenomenon firsthand.  I can’t say that I agree with a cultural dynamic where a woman’s job is to serve me, but I'd be lying if I said it isn’t a wonderful feeling.
