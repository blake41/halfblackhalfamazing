One of the biggest things I was curious to discover, and experience first hand was racism in Australia compared to in the US.  One of the things I’ve always heard about Australia is how racist it is.  However, my experience was quite the opposite.  I felt more comfortable in Australia than in a lot of places in the US.  I also asked the Indian girl I went out with what her thoughts were and she didn’t think there was any racism in Australia.  I think that should be taken with a grain of salt given that she is a particularly attractive girl and therefore I would guess significantly less likely to experience racism no matter where she is.  I also asked two Aussies who were bankers, about my age, basically the same demographic as most of my friends in NY.  They felt that there was no racism, and if anything America was much more racist.  A Jewish American girl who was part of this discussion totally disagreed and felt that while she didn’t feel any overt anti Semitism she did feel like there was a lack of exposure of most Aussie’s which caused her to feel uncomfortable expressing her religion.  So there is my statistically insignificant sample of racism in Australia.  Take it for what you will.
