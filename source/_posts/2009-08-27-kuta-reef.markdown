Surfed Kuta Reef which was really cool.  You take a boat out to a break maybe 5 minutes out by boat.  The wave was a gorgeous left that was steep and peeled all the way down the line.  Best day of surf I've ever had.  Absolutely shredded some waves including an overhead set wave.  What a cool experience.![IMGP2570](http://halfblackhalfamazing.files.wordpress.com/2009/08/imgp2570.jpg)
