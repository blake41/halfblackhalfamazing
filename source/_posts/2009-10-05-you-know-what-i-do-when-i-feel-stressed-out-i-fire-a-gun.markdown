Let me start in the middle because I am just so excited about this.  I rented a motorbike on Ko Samui and as I was heading home to catch my plane I heard gunshots and saw a shooting range to my left.  I hit the brakes and veered into the driveway to check it out.  I had the range to myself with the exception of the three Thai people who worked there who were shooting for fun while they were waiting for customers.  I picked the .45 because it was the gun I always see in the movies and they showed me how to load it while they laughed at me for not knowing how to do it.  If you’ve never shot a gun before I highly recommend it.  As sick as it sounds, holding a gun gives you an amazing feeling of power and when you shoot it it is such a release.  I was also pretty impressed with my targeting skills as I got a head, shoulder and heart shot on my first three.  Just another angry black man with a gun I guess….[gallery]
