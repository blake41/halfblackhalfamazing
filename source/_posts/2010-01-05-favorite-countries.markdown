I'm probably going to do a bad job of this due to the fact that things fade over time in terms of my excitement over them, but here's my best shot at ranking the places i've been.

1. Laos - Amazingly beautiful.  Luang Prabang is super chill.  Boat ride down Mekong river may be my favorite 2 days of the whole trip.
2. Argentina - Buenos Aires is gorgeous, french architecture, really cheap, friendly people, great clubs, beautiful women, amazing vineyards, hiking, rafting, hang gliding, patagonia.
3. Brazil - Rio, Floripa, enough said.
4. Japan - The most different developed country you can go to.  Beautiful scenery, friendly people, great food, Tokyo rules.
5. Hong Kong - New York in Asia.  Spectacular view from the tram to the top of the city, beautiful beaches and hikes 20 minutes outside of the city.
6. China - Just so different.  Yangshuo may be the most beautiful place I've ever been.  Also just so crazy and hectic.
7. Thailand - Amazing beaches and islands in the south.  Northern Thailand is super chill.  Elephant rides, zip lines, trekking. 
8. Bali - Killer Surf, best waves I've ever surfed.  Super cheap, great people.  Too many Aussies.
9. Sydney - Amazing to have a proper city and amazing beaches right there.  Just too high a cost:awesomeness ratio.
10. Hawaii - Hawaii rules but i've been before so just not that exciting.
11.Kuala Lumpur - It just sucked.
