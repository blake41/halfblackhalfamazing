I've been debating whether or not I'd continue writing this blog, seeing as I got burned out in Brazil and never even wrote about Carnival.  However I was inspired by Nicola with the great title she gave me.  Me Russ and Forrest head out tomorrow for the first leg of what looks to be an epic summer.  We leave JFK at 2pm, fly through Iceland and arrive in Copenhagen at 6AM.  Emma is meeting us at the train station and we are going to drop our stuff off at her place before proceeding to the Roskilde Festival.  The festival looks pretty insane, 70,000 people and a killer lineup of bands.  The girls were nice enough to get all our stuff all set up so all we have to do is just roll in and tents and chairs and stuff will already be waiting for us.  All we have to bring is booze and a sense of adventure!  I've spent quite a lot of time picking up gear for the festival as we are going to be the American camp and as such have to represent properly.  I have face paint, fabric markers to make shirts, an LED belt buckle, red white and blue wayfarers, an american flag, a ghetto blaster with an ipod hookup, and probably a bunch of other crap I've already forgotten.  Leigh flies in to join us at the festival Friday and leaves Sunday.  After the festival we spend two nights in Copenhagen at Emma's and then fly out on the night of the 6th to Leigh's place in Paris.  According to Russ his place is in a sweet location, west village style. Pretty pumped to see Europe, and try out my French for the first time.  I finally feel like a true blue blooded Ivy league douchebag backpacking around Europe for a summer!  When I'm talking to a girl who goes, OMG I LOOOOVE PARIS I can say OMG ME TOO LOL!!!  Not sure if my stories this summer will be as good for blogging as I can no longer shamelessly embarrass myself with women, but I hope to put up some good pics and share some good moments from time to time.  Hopefully having a girlfriend won't preclude tons of fun adventures this summer.  At the worst I can just tell some stories about sketchy Leigh.  I guess there's only one way to find out.  Juice out.
