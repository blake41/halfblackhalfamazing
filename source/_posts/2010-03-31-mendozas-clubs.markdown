The highlight of my trip to Mendoza's nightlife had to be our crazy trip outside of the city.  A few nights prior Josh had been out to some clubs outside of the city, which sounded sketchy when it had first been suggested but he came back reporting that these were the biggest clubs he had ever been to and that they had a crazy fun time.  Josh's 2 Irish and 1 British buddies came by the hostel and we all pregamed together before migrating to an Irish bar in town.  After everyone was fired up to go out, we all got in taxis and headed to the club, except plans went awry when none of josh's friends came in our cab, and he forgot where this place was.  So we just described to the taxi driver what we were looking for.  A club outside of the city that held about 30,000 people.  The driver was like ahh  si and we headed out.  We drove for about 30 minutes into a really remote area that reminded me of some wealthy part of Sao Paulo.  Like giant fields and huge Haciendas with giant walls.  We rolled up to the gate of one of them to be told by the guards toting weapons that we were not in the right place.  Not to be deterred the taxi driver told us he'd find something.  About 20 minutes further out of town we rolled up to the largest club I've ever seen by at least 5 times.  It made the clubs in Cancun look like children's forts. Oddly we had to pay for our drinks before we got into the club, so Josh and I bought 4 drinks each not knowing what the deal was.  Mel and another girl who had to be home at like 6AM to catch a flight were with us and we all went to pick up our drinks.  When I asked for a red bull vodka, they gave me a full glass of vodka, and a full redbull.  My kind of club.  We all lost each other within minutes and I proceeded to dance and party solo for the rest of the night.  I randomly ran into Josh at about 6AM when the club closed at a food stand as I was staaaaarving.  We grabbed a cab and headed home both smiling and in awe of the evening.[gallery]
