We got screwed by the people who sold us our ferry ticket who claimed we would be in Gili by night time.  As soon as we got to Lombok our driver informed us it would be another 800 Rupiah to get to Gili that night so we decided to get a hotel and take the cheap ferry we had already paid for in the morning.  Lombok is pretty crazy in that it’s a Muslim island, and there are mosques absolutely everywhere.  It was Ramadan, so all of them were packed with prayer services going on at all hours of the night and morning.  It boggles my  mind that two islands could be so close, and yet have totally different religions, cultures, languages etc.
