Hello loyal blog readers!

I've noticed on the blog stats that the readership seems to have huge peaks and troughs based on when I get a chance to update the blog.  I am constantly writing posts on my netbook while I travel, but don't always get to update, so sometimes I'll throw up 7 posts at a time to catch up, the blog gets a spike, and then trickles down as there's no new posts.  So I just figured out how to queue up posts, which means now I'll have a new post for you every day, unless I'm away from the internet for like a week, and if you're reading that, you know that if I haven't been on the internet for a week, I'm already dead, and it's silly to keep refreshing your browser in hopes of new posts. So come visit me once a day to get your daily dose of my campaign to promote American idiocy abroad.
