Had  pretty terrible day of surf at Kuta Beach.  Caught only a few waves due to crowds, tons of longboarders and shitty waves.  Meg (my old roomate from Hawaii) joined us from Australia.  She rolled in late, we grabbed some beers and hit the streets.  Daniel, or Balinesian friend came out with us as well.  We checked out Skygarden which was pretty uneventful except for this...![Go Go Dancers](http://halfblackhalfamazing.files.wordpress.com/2009/08/img_0102.jpg)Four Balinesian girls came out and did a sick little dance number behind the bar and then danced on the bars.  Maybe the most amazing legs I have ever seen.
