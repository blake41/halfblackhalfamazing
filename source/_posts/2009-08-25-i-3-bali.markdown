We landed in Bali after having not slept in Hong Kong the night before and sleeping about 6 hours on planes during the journey from Hong Kong to Bali.  We hadn’t gotten a hotel because most hotels in Bali don’t book online.  We stopped at the hotel booking place in the hotel and tried to find a cheap hotel but since it’s high season everything reasonable was booked.  We got a hotel for 400,000 Rupieh which is about 40 USD in Kuta.  We hopped in a cab and headed to the hotel.  Kuta looked similarly to what I had expected.  The main strip (Legian street) is really built up and is surf shops, souvenir shops and bars/resturants.  This place is truly the surfers paradise.  I have never seen such a concentration of surf culture in one place.  Everyone you see here is decked out in only surf brands and has the long shaggy blonde surfer ‘do.  Also, all the girls here are gorgeous from the locals to the tourists.  I think I may have died and gone to heaven.

After we checked into our hotel we went on a search for boards to rent.  We walked down Poppies lane where we were told all the surf shops would be, but every shop that sold boards did not rent, and the few we discovered that did rent had sh*tty boards for too much.  Finally we met a local named Daniel who brought us to his friend Yopi’s shop and we found the board selection we were looking for.  Leigh and I both rented 7’ 2” fun boards for 35,000 R (3.50 USD) a day which were pretty dope.  Yopi’s shop was awesome and everyone was so cool.  They invited us to join them for drinks and we drank whisky and coke which is the cheapest way to drink on the island.  Amazingly, Yopi came to Bali from the jungle in Sumatra where he wore only a loincloth until 4 years ago.  The tsunami actually carried him to Bali on a tree, not joking, and he has been here ever since.  He loves Bali and speaks near perfect English.  The third member of their crew was Rama who was real chill and played the guitar while we all chilled out.  Danielle told us to join him at Kuta beach the next day where he teaches surfing and he said we could leave our boards at his rack on the beach and go walk around after we were done surfing.  I can’t get over how nice and cool everyone is here.  After renting the boards we headed to grab some dinner on Legian street and stopped at a nice open air restaurant.  Of course I fell in love with our waitress who was an absolute goddess but unfortunately she had a ring on.  After dinner we were pretty exhausted and headed to bed.
