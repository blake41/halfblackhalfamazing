Kuta wears on you pretty quickly as it is loud and crowded constantly.  We decided to check out Seminyak which we had heard was way more chill and more upscale.  We checked out the Anantara Resort right on Seminyak beach for some drinks.  Seminyak is soooo much nicer than Kuta.  The minute you cross the border the shops immediately become more upscale and everything relaxes quite a bit.  The resort was gorgeous and we got a nice table overlooking the beach and had some drinks.  We then headed to a pretty nice restaurant, Rumours, for dinner.  Had pretty good food and we headed home sleepy and satiated.
