Pretty Epicly bad start to my time in Thailand.  9 Hour flight, 2 hour delay put me in the airport in Phuket at 11PM.  The money changer tried to rip me off giving me around 120 USD less than I was supposed to get.  I didn't question it because I've never had a legit currency exchange in an airport try to rip me off.  When I got outside I did the math and had to go back through airport security and caught them just as they were leaving.  Thank god they didn't put up a fight and just gave me what they shorted me.  Welcome to Thailand.  After that my minibus driver said he would take me to my hotel but once we got into town and drove around a while he said he didn't know where it was.  Luckily another woman in the minibus owned a hotel and offered to let me use her phone/internet to find my hotel and let me stay at hers if worst came to worst.  I finally found my hotel at around 130AM and so ended a long first day/night in Thailand.
