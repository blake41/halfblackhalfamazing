Our second night in Hong Kong we took the Star Ferry to Kowloon Island.  The ferry gives you an incredible view of the Hong  Kong skyline which I would like to reiterate has got to be the best in the world.  We checked out the Peninsula hotel which is a 5 star hotel with a bar on the 28th floor which overlooks the water and has a great view of Hong Kong Island.  We retired pretty early in hopes of getting an early start on Tuesday and hitting up Lantau Island before heading to Shenzen.  We got a bit of a late start on Tuesday as we were trying to find a surf shop we had spotted a few days earlier and ended up chatting with the cashier there for about an hour.  He told us we didn’t have time to go to Lantau but should check out Sham Shui Po.  We caught the MTR over there and found that Sham Shui Po was exactly what I had pictured Hong Kong to be like;  Street vendors everywhere selling just about anything for almost nothing.  Leigh bought some shoes, I got a backpack and some other trinkets and then we caught the MTR back to check out of our hotel and get the train to Shenzen.
