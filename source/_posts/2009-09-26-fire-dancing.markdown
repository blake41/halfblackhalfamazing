The first day of Scuba class was pretty boring as it mainly consisted of watching terrible PADI videos and taking tests.  Class got out around dinnertime and I headed to dinner with my group.  There's 5 of us in the group including myself, two Israeli boy/girl twins, a girl from Poland, and an English kid.  It's a good group and everyone seems nice and friendly.  We all walked into Suri beach which is the little town near our dive resort.  The town is pretty beautiful at night decorated with all sorts of colored lights and hanging lanterns along a small path.  I ran into Rachel, the girl who introduced me to Gary the bunny and I kicked it with her and Adam and Gary for a few hours at the bar that she works at (AC bar).  Tarik, a Burmese guy who works for the bar was doing fire dancing outside on the beach so I went outside to watch him.  Rachel asked me if I wanted to give it a try and I was stoked.  Tarik gave me some lessons and after some practice without fire I pimped a little Fire Dancing show that I was pretty impressed with for my first time.  Definitely need to get better at this as the sh*t.  The moves that Tarik could do looked so badass.
