After a short 1 hour plane ride from Shenzen we arrived in Guilin.  The taxi ride to our hotel from the aiport took about 30 minutes and had pretty amazing scenery.  Guilin is what you think of when you picture China.  Beautiful lush greenery and rolling hills and mountains.  No one speaks English here and it is very local.  We slept all day and went out to dinner at a Chinese restaurant.  We got chicken, beef and dumplings along with some rice.  The chicken was not like Chicken you get at an American Chinese restaurant.  They give you the WHOLE CHICKEN.  Head, eyes, feet, wings, heart.  Most of you reading this probably know what a picky eater I am but I tried to be adventurous and eat some of it until Leigh pointed out the heart and then I felt like I was going to be sick.  I know that probably makes me a stupid American tourist but I couldn’t pretend to like it.  The beef was ok and the dumplings were good.  Headed back to the hotel and will probably walk around the city later tonight.
