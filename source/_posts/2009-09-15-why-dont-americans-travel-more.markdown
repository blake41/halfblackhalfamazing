title: Why Don't Americans Travel More

There seems to be a common characterization among foreigners that Americans don't travel.  I'd say this is relatively accurate as in I don't think we travel on average as much as many other countries particularly the English.  I've been thinking about why this might be true and whether this is a cultural choice that we don't value travel, or whether there might be simple logistical reasons that contribute to the end result much more.  

First off let me say that the idea of the Gap Year is phenomenal, and it's unclear to me why this is not a standard in America like it is in many other places.  I wish we had it, and I wish I had taken advantage of it.

I believe Americans don't travel as much as other countries mostly due to our geographic place in the world.  America, with the exception of maybe the USSR or China has the largest relatively homogeneous geographic area anywhere in the world.  Aussie's can hop on a plane and hit so many countries in a concentrated geographic locale (southeast asia).  Europeans can travel all around Europe hitting tons of countries while a similar geographic journey around the states would only get you to 1 country.  We are surrounded by Mexico and Canada so as a landmass we have three countries two of whom are remarkably similar while almost any other similarly sized landmass would have at least 20 or so countries.
