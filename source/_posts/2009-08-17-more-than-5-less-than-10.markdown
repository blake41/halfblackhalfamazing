I'm trying to hit at least 5 and most likely less than 10 countries in two continents over the next 4-6 months.  The trip was supposed to start in India but due to delays with work I had to skip it.  I still had to fly into Delhi, down to Mumbai, and take a cab from the domestic to international terminals in Mumbai.  For some reason the terminals are not connected and it takes about 30 minutes to travel 10km to the international terminal.  Just that 30 minute ride through Mumbai was a pretty eye opening experience.  I was struck first by the massive amount of people everywhere.  The level of poverty was also at a level I had never experienced.  People walk across the highways in bare feet.  A family surrounded my car and was knocking on the windows begging for food.

My short time in India really drove home the point that we are incredibly lucky to have been born where we are.  When KG screamed "anything is possible" he should've qualified it with "as long as you grew up in a country with social mobility".  The whole concept of a caste system is antithetical to how Americans perceive the world.  While I often see people unhappy in their work in NY, they at least get to choose their miserable lives.  It is not what we choose, but the choice itself that we should be thankful for.![Taxi Ride in Mumbai](http://halfblackhalfamazing.files.wordpress.com/2009/08/img_0009.jpg)
