Matt took us on an epic hike on Monday called the Maclehose trail.  We did the second of a 10 part trail.  It was 12K and one of the most beautiful hikes I’ve ever been on.  The terrain was really hilly and you are basically walking through the mountains down to beaches and then back up through the mountains.  We stopped at Big Wave Beach which was oddly named given that there wasn’t even a hint of any waves.  They were renting surfboards at the beach which was quite the tease because Leigh and I had been hoping the whole hike that we’d discover some waves and be able to mess around with some long boards but alas it was not to be.  It must have been about 90 degrees and we all were completely soaked with sweat about an hour into the hike.  The water at big wave bay was really warm and felt incredible after a few hours of hiking.  After a brief stop to play in the water we continued on and hiked the rest of the trail.  The end of the trail overlooks some gorgeous blue rivers and then takes you back to a main road.  After this hike I was pretty amazed that Matt had run this entire trail (all 100KM) in a competition as we were totally spent after just one section of it.
