So if you are wondering about the lack of posts, it is because my computer got stolen.  It kind of took the wind out of my sails as far as keeping this blog up to date.  I am headed back to NYC in less than an hour and should be home on friday by 8pm.  More for my own diaries sake than anything else I might put up some posts that finish out the journey as I have not posted about mendoza, patagonia, BA, paraty, isla grande or carnaval.
