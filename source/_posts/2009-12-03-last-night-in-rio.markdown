The last night in Rio was pretty quiet.  I checked into the Cabana Copa hostel in Copacabana intending not to go out.  However I sat at the bar for a bit because I had fallen in love with the bartender.  The sweetest sexiest Brazillian girl with an amazing accent was making caipirinha's and i couldn't say no.  Met a Sweedish guy, an American couple from LA, a British girl and a few others I can't remember.  We went to a local pizzeria and then headed to a local Samba bar called Bip Bip.  It was supposed to be a super chill local bar, but we got there at 11pm right after the band had left.  It was still a pretty cool scene, kind of French cafe style spilling out onto the street.  People outside drinking beers and having a good time and chilling.  The guy who ran the bar clearly used to be a baller in the music world because there's pics of him all over the inside of the bar with all these badass musicians.  Was disappointed I missed the music but it's on my list for when I get back to Rio.  We stopped for some late night Acai and then headed to bed around 2AM.  [gallery]
