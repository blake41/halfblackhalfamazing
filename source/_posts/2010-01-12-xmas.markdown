Xmas in BA was awesome.  Most people slept until 2pm or so and then came down to the main bar area and just chilled all day.  I made some xmas phone calls, messed around on the computer and took it easy.  There was a big group of Irish who got wasted and put on these Irish folk songs and were all singing and dancing.  It was pretty awesome[![](http://halfblackhalfamazing.files.wordpress.com/2010/01/img_1032.jpg)](http://halfblackhalfamazing.files.wordpress.com/2010/01/img_1032.jpg)
