I went to San Telmo, which is a really cool area of the city, the village of BA if you will.  We went to a great steakhouse (of course) for dinner and walked around the cobblestone streets a bit.  We ran into a street party on the way there.  There were a whole bunch of people playing drums in the streets and everyone was dancing.  We danced for a while and then headed to dinner.[gallery][youtube=http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EnfQKFyEOn0]
