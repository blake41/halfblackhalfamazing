I've spent the past few days researching RWT's and potential travel options.  I finally pulled the trigger yesterday and bought a bunch of tickets.  My journey now looks like:
Country and Arrival date
Thailand	9/21/2009
Laos	10/11/2009
Singapore	10/17/2009
Shanghai	10/19/2009
Beijing	10/21/2009
Tokyo	10/23/2009
Honolulu	10/28/2009
LA	11/16/2009
Sao Paulo	11/18/2009
Rio 11/18/2009
Lima 2/15/2010

Does anyone have any tips on where to go/what to see in South America?
