I left early in the morning from Vientiane in order to catch my flight to Kuala Lumpur.  I emailed my old friend from Dartmouth/Novack Café to let him know I was headed to Singapore and to make dinner plans for that evening.  However, I found out the Kuala Lumpur is in Malaysia and not Singapore!  Who knew.  It’s weird that I thought that, because I had looked at the map when I was coming East from India through KL and saw that Singapore was on the bottom of Malaysia, and knew I was in Malaysia when I stopped over in KL on the way to Hong Kong, but somehow I got the idea that it was in both Singapore and Malaysia?  Anyways dear reader, I can assure you that Singapore is a different country than Malaysia.  
Other than that, I have very little to say.  I went to see this giant cave with a big gold statue out front that is used as a temple but it was pretty underwhelming.  On the whole KL was pretty boring.  The highlight of my time there was missing my flight and spending a whole day in the airport.  I met a Chinese girl who was on her way back from Australia and who lived in Beijing.  We ended up kicking it for like 6 hours and made plans to meet up when I got to Beijing.
