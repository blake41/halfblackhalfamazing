I did a little shopping today, looking for some presents for friends back home.  I went to a little store that had some cool stuff and started bargaining for two items.  "How much for two?" "350,000 for one she replied."  I smiled and laughed because we both knew she was full of sh*t.  "100,000 for two I countered."  "No no this is the new kind she said."  I started laughing because we both knew there were shops everywhere selling the exact same things I was trying to buy.  "I like you" she told me, " how about 150,000 and a kiss?"  "Done".  So I gave her a little kiss on the cheek, and thus my first kiss in Bali was to a cute little 40 year old woman.
