We roused slowly and made our way into town to get some sushi to see if we could start putting healthy things into our bodies and nurse them back to health.  After sushi, we did some laundry, went to the park for some wiffle ball, and generally just attempted to waste the day away.  Fo and Russ went to an internet cafe for coffee and catching up on "real life" while Emma and I went shopping in preparation for the nights bbq.  Pernille and Helene arrived around 7:30 and they cooked up some pesto pasta.  In addition we made peppers, salad, burgers, potato salad, and hot dogs.  A pretty epic feast.  Emmas rooftop is a luxury style with hardwood on the top running the length of the building along with wood tables and comfy chairs, lights and a propane grill.  It's pretty baller and I'm pumped to make good use of it this summer.  Tine showed up late to the feast around 11 with one of her friends Tove and we played a game of pass the pigs, drank a few bottles of wine and headed into her bedroom for some boce, jack daniels, and general mischief.  Emma and I passed out early because we were both sick.
