I woke up at 7:00 AM despite having gone to bed around 4AM the night before.  The island was even more deserted than usual and I decided to walk West around the island to see how far I could go.  It was a really cool experience to walk around such a beautiful place and be the only person up.  I walked for about 2 hours around the west coast of the island past the developed part of the island to beautiful deserted white sand beaches.  I took some pics of myself meditating and chilling on the beach.  At around 9:30 I got nervous that It’d take forever so I convinced one of the carts that came by in the opposite direction to let me jump in and they gave me a ride back into town.  I met up with the guys for breakfast, we checked out of our hotel, and met up with the English girls back at Rudy’s.  Our boat sailed in from Lombok about an hour later and they picked us up on the dinghy.  Our boat was really cool, with a nice deck, a spacious cabin, a dinner table bolted to the deck, and a second floor built above the stern half of the boat.  We headed to Gili Meno to do some snorkeling.  Almost as soon as we headed out, one of the girls got seasick.  After an hour she decided to go back, so we sent her ashore on the dinghy with one of her friends.  The day was one of the best I’ve ever had.  The weather was beautiful, the snorkeling was fun, and we had a great group of people.  We watched the sunset from the water, while doing all sorts of flips and jumps off the top level of the boat.  After the sunset, Yosef (the only crewmember who spoke English) made us a fantastic dinner, and we drank a few beers on the boat.  We all headed back ashore, the girls back to shower, and us back to Rudys.  The bartenders at Rudys are definitely the best part about the bar.  At the beginning of the night, they all had straws in their ears, and we couldn’t figure out what they were there for.  But as things got fired up they would use them as microphones and sing their favorite songs.  They also would make fun of anyone with a funny accent (like the English and Australians), hilarious dudes.  We met some cool people at the bar, and then our English girls showed up and we chilled out with them playing cards and what not until we had to leave to head to our boat at midnight.  Once we got on board the crew got ready and started the engines to sail overnight to Nusa Lembogan.
