I was pretty fired up to get back to China and see what the two major cities held for me, but as usual my experience in China was a mixed bag.  No one in the airport I asked for help/directions from let me know that there was a maglev train that went 400km/hr and took 8 minutes to get to the city center from the airport.  Instead I got scammed into taking a taxi who told me it’d be about 100 RMB and that he’d take a credit card but ended up being 300 RMB.  I didn’t have any RMB so I had to go to a bank and change my Thai Baht for RMB the waiting for which was included in the fair.  Absolute horsesh*t.  Then he took me to the wrong hotel, the correct name, but a different address so I had to lose my deposit on the other hotel and just checked into the one he brought me to.  But such is life in China.  After that little fiasco everything in Shanghai was awesome.  Despite losing a night there due to my idiocy in missing my flight, I still had a decent amount of time to see the sights in Shanghai, which aren’t very numerous.  Shanghai is much more a proper city, unlike what I experienced in Guilin and Shenzen.
I spent my first day there learning the subways, cruising around by myself downtown.  The center of the city is pretty cool, with huge pedestrian streets almost twice as wide as any street in Manhattan.  Really cool shops and nice little cafes in addition to tons of pretty impressive skyscrapers.  Around 5PM I got some dinner and Herbert’s boyfriend Ben came to meet up with me at the café I was at.  We hopped the train to meet up with Billings near where he worked in Jing’an.  It was a cool little Belgian bar and he was with his business partner who had drinks with us as well.  After a few hours of drinks and some good times Ben and I headed to meet up with the Spanish couple I had met on my trek in Thailand.  We met them at a subway station that was near what I would call the Times Square of China.  Lots of big colorful lights and crazy displays.  Thank god I had met up with Ben earlier as it would have been impossible to locate them without his cell phone.  When we finally found them we headed to a cheap Chinese restaurant that was really good and really reasonably priced.  We had some spicy beef over rice along with Sake and some beers.  After that we headed to the local pub near where the Spanish couple lived for a last round of beers.  It was a really awesome way to end the night in Shanghai, so good to see those guys again.  Ben and I had planned on hitting a Chinese club afterwards but it was already one and he had to get to bed for work.
