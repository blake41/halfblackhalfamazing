Day 3 was more of the same.  Probably a noon wakeup, a little food, and then Kings of Convenience and Vampire Weekend.  Kings of Convenience was chill and we just sat in the grass at the back.  Vampire Weekend was really fun and somehow we lucked out and got right up at the front I think because we cut a ton of people who had been waiting in line.  After that we returned to camp for dinner and more wiffle ball.  Again we required a pull of scotch and bought 3 more cases of beer to start getting festive.  The American flag drew a lot of attention and a lot of Americans came by to take a few swings.  Met a bunch of cool people.

The highlight was a sportscaster worthy grab that I made where I jumped in the air over this guy but sort of clipped him with my shoulder.  I barely grazed him but he honestly acted like I had punched him in the face.  I apologized profusely and he ended up giving US HIS CASE OF BEER.  Still unclear how that one worked itself out.  We were also able to watch football on a giant screen while we were playing which was cool.  After wiffle ball we headed back to the camp for more beer bowling.  We got a good crew together and all headed out to see Prodigy who was supposed to be epic.  However when we got there, it kind of blew.  So we stayed for about 20 minutes and then set out to cause trouble.  I think Russ and I lost everyone somehow so we went to buy a bottle of Jack and go on some missions.  We ended up meeting two Danish girls in the line for booze and ended up hanging out all night with them.  One of them spoke fluent French so of course Russell fell in love with her and at some point I lost them and went wandering by myself and ran into Forrest at some point.  There was some early morning dance party going on so we tried to get into that but it wasn't really happening so we went and hung out at the DJ tent before crashing.
