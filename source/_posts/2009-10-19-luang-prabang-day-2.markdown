Woke up pretty late as we were all pretty hungover and grabbed food and a tuk tuk to the waterfalls.  The waterfalls are pretty awesome.  The best one is 60meters but there are many at different points in the river.  They also have rescued Asiatic Black Bears that were awesome to check out.  They have this whole campus built for them and they just kick it.  They look like all they want is a remote and a few beers and there life would be complete.  Was pretty exhausted this night so I slept for like 4 hours after returning from the waterfalls.  When I woke up Pim and I went to get food with the English girls and Webb and made plans to meet the English girls at the bowling alley in a short time.  I had to do about an hour of work so I headed to the internet café to knock that out.  By the time I had finished my work it was almost 11PM and Pim and the English girls were curled up in bed watching TV.  I headed to the bowling alley solo but no one was there so I turned right around.  I ran into Denmark, Germany and Sweeden.  Denmark came to hang out with me down by the river.  There was a great little café situated right over the river that was closed so I grabbed a beer and we just chilled down by the river for a few hours.  It was so peaceful and relaxing, [gallery]
