Made a last minute decision to go to Sydney because there wasn't really any internet in Indonesia and I need to get some work done.  Meg was leaving Sydney and her roomate was looking for someone to the sublet the day I was leaving Bali so everything worked out perfectly.

It's been kind of a whirlwind since I've got here. Slept most of my first day, and then went to an event called the big blind.  It was run by one of Meg and her roomate's friends Gina.  It was basically like a group blind date where a bunch of young people some single some not get together and do some kind of fun event.  The event of the evening was salsa dancing and drinks a Thraner's bar in Kings Cross.  Surprising a pretty fun evening and a nice way to meet some new people right after arriving in Australia.  I've been thinking about "dating" in NYC for a long time and have often thought about running similar things in NY but haven't solved all the issues I see with it yet.  Attending this event was inspiring as I think she solved a lot of the issues I've always had with the idea, although there were still problems.  While I was at the event I met a really cool girl who I convinced to take me out and show me Sydney.  She is quite an interesting character.  She's only 21 but has more of a sense of self than almost anyone I know of any age.  Oddly enough she's the second girl I've been out on a date with that is a beauty pageant winner.  Never thought I would be interested in girls that did beauty pageants, but apparently they are not all as vapid as Miss California. Add Miss India to Miss Colorado.![IMG_0385](http://halfblackhalfamazing.files.wordpress.com/2009/09/img_0385.jpg)
