Finally got back to Hong Kong after an exhausting flight and train ride.  I can’t remember the last time I was so happy to get somewhere, but returning to Hong Kong feels like returning home after being in China.  We got a room at the Hotel Jen which was awesome, half the price of our other hotel (like 50 USD) centrally located, and so much nicer.  I recommend anyone who visits HK to stay there.  It has an open air rooftop pool, awesome 28th floor bar overlooking the city, and a great buffet breakfast.  We were supposed to meet up with Angad but we waited till about 11:30 PM and he still was at work ( I don’t understand why these finance people do it).  We went to Wung Fan, a great dumpling place on wellington street recommended by Matt.  Headed back to our hotel and drank a bottle of Rum which was terrible.  We took a cab to tonic because it was the only bar we knew of, and then walked around the different bars in central basically following any cute girls we saw.  Hong Kong doesn’t seem like the type of place where you pick a bar and go to it for the night, everyone seems to move in and out of each bar every 10 minutes which is probably due to everything having an open front rather than a door.  The night was pretty fun, went to drop and gecko and a couple other random spots I don’t remember.  We met a bunch of groups of cute girls but nothing really came out of it.  I met the only two black guys I saw in my entire time in HK and they were real chill.  They had just come back from Bali from a wedding of one of the guys tenants.  He must be an awesome landlord to get invited to a tenants wedding.  He said indo girls do not drink or go out, only indo girls out are pro’s.  Grabbed some late night philly cheese steaks and tried to convince some girls we met there to come back to our hotel and jump in the pool (which we knew was closed) with us to no avail.  Then headed back to the hotel.  Packed up our stuff and headed out to the airport as we had a 9am flight.  3rd time pulling an all nighter on the trip so far.  The Hong Kong nightlife is awesome, and probably would be more awesome if you lived there, or spent more time getting into the scene.
