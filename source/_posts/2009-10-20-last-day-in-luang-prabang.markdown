Rented motorbikes around 1 and headed to another waterfall. These waterfalls weren’t as spectacular but were still pretty cool.  You drive about 45 minutes out of the city, which was a great ride on the bikes.  However before we had even gotten 200 Meters out of the motorbike rental a giant tour bus swerved into out lane coming at us and we had to dodge out of the way.  Keith layed his bike down and hit the pavement pretty hard.  I was worried he’d broken something or totally scraped up his left side but somehow his glasses were unharmed and he was unhurt for the most part.  The bike was a bit messed up so we walked back to the shop and they fixed the gear shifter that was getting jammed and we were off again.  Once you get to the river you park your bike and take a longtail boat about 5 minutes up the river.  Spent a few hours hiking around the waterfalls all the way to the furthest one in the back which was awesome because it was just me Holland and Jermaine and no other tourists.  We did some swimming and headed back to grab some food.  Ran into Webb again and all headed back to town together.  Met up with the rest of the crew and we all went out to get food and drinks.  We had planned to go out but instead just went home to play cards and chill.  Finally heard from Preitty who can’t come to Laos because she couldn’t get an appointment for something she needed to do in Bangkok until the end of October so it didn’t make sense to come this early.  Kind of glad as it’s been so much fun travelling alone and meeting people.  Totally different dynamic then when you are with people.  I can’t believe how much I prefer rolling by myself with no obligations to anyone.  Been spending a lot more time alone these days then I am used to.
