I just watched a Jim Carey movie called Yes Man.  It’s of the general variety of kitchy pretty bad movies that he’s churned out over the years.  However, I really enjoyed it as I think the message of the movie is a positive one.  Say yes to everything.  I’ve been trying to do this as much as I can on this trip.  If you’re reading this blog, you probably know me pretty well, and I don’t think anyone would ever accuse me of being closed minded, or the type of person who’s reluctant to try new things (except for food).  Despite that, I’m trying to keep my mind open to new experiences and be even more open minded than I normally would.  And I think, say yes to everything is a pretty good guiding principle for this trip.  So I’m going to put myself out there as much as possible and say yes to as many different things as possible.  I’ve been trying to convince a bunch of different people to come meet me at the end of the trip in South America, and I’m hoping they will be as apt to say yes and come join as I am on my journey.
