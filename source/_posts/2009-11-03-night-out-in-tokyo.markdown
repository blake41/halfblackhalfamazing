After the money debacle, I told myself I was hitting the town hard.  It was a Saturday night, and I wanted to see what Tokyo had to offer in the partying department. I treated myself to my favorite restaurant, Gyu Kaku, then bought a tall boy, and two fifths of Whiskey.  I sat in my room alone and pregamed.  The front desk guy at the hostel had suggested I got to Roppingo, and to take the last train which was 12:30.  At around midnight I headed over to the subway station only to find the last train was 11:56!  Come on.  So I hopped in a cab and paid the 60,000 Yen it cost to get to Roppingo.  A total ripoff given that the train costs 2,000 Yen, but I wasn't going to waste my only opportunity to go out in Tokyo to save 60 bucks.  When I arrived in Roppingo I knew I was going to have a great time.  I saw three people walking and asked them if I could join them wherever they were going.  The dude who was kind of the leader of the group was from Alabama but had been teaching English in Japan for 8 years.  Cool dude.  He'd just come from a bachelor party where everyone had gone to bed already...seriously?  There was a hot asian girl from Cali who did Educational research, and an asian dude I did not get to meet.  They had all just sort of met up at the bachelor party but didn't know each other prior to that.  We went to some club, I didn't even see the name, and it had a 4,000 yen cover and came with two free drinks.  Crazy expensive in my mind, but drinks were about 1,000 Yen so really you were paying 2,000 Yen cover with a 2 drink minimum, not terrible.  The club was awesome and I bought the dude from Alabama, Adam, a beer for letting me join their crew.  I kicked it with the girl from Cali for a while, but I don't remember her name.  The rest of the night is kind of a blur.  I was there until 5AM but couldn't tell you what I did for most of the time there.  At some point around 5AM I woke up in a chair by the pool table by myself.  I walked outside the club and ran into two dudes who were going to get food so I hopped in a cab with them.  One of the dudes was from Texas and was honestly the biggest donkey I have ever met.  Can we just nuke that state already?  Or at least revoke their right to have a passport and travel?  It's embarrassing.  The other kid was from Portugal and was really chill.  They were both studying abroad in South Korea and were in Tokyo for the weekend.  The dude from Portugal was trying to explain to the Texas dude to be more careful when they are out because he had gotten agressive with two Yakuza and one Sicilian guy who could have had him killed in like 5 seconds.  This kid was like I'm not scared of them blah blah blah such a retard I considered killing myself at least 5 times during the cab ride.  He also kept rubbing the cab drivers head who was this nice old Japanese guy, so disrespectful.  They wanted to go to the fish market, which is closed on Sundays, so we drove around for a while with the cabbie trying to explain that to the kid from Texas who kept insisting that he was taking us to the wrong place.  He took us to the fish market, but it was just closed.  At that point I was like I'm out guys, you enjoy.  And I saw a McDonalds that opened at 6AM which was in 15 minutes.  I sat down, enjoyed about 15 minutes of episode 3 of true blood, and then had the best two sausage mcmuffins with egg i've ever eaten.  Then I hopped on the train and crashed hard when I got back to my hotel.

For some reason I only took one picture.  Very sad story and uncharacteristic of me.
