Xmas eve is one of the biggest party nights in Buenos Aires.  Our hostel had a big party up until 2am and then had a shuttle that took people to Pasha.  Pasha is a bit pricey so I didn't want to roll there.  I ended up going with about 8 people over to a more local stye club around 3 or 4am.  We danced all night at this place and had a blast.  Per usual when we left the club it was fully light out.
