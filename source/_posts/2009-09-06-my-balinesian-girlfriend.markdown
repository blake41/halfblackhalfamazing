We kept the villa for two nights, and then Leigh left so we figured it was crazy to split the villa three ways so we went back to Kuta.  Every time I walked by this one massage parlor one of the girls would say hi handsome how are you!  So today when everyone left to go back, I decided to go chat her up.  Her name is Katlina and she's really cool.  I got a massage and we kicked it for a few hours today.  She wanted to get drinks tonight after she gets out of work but my plane is leaving an hour after she gets out of work and I'd miss it.
