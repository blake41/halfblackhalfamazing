Although my first full day in Thailand consisted of traveling all day, it was much better than the day before.  I watched the first season of Californication while a taxi took me to Surat Thani from Phuket where I boarded an overnight sleeper boat to Ko Tao.  I had about 4 hours to wait before the boat took off, so I decided to drink some beers.  I met three Americans and one German who had made a similar decision and were headed to Ko Tao as well.  The Americans were from Seattle and one had been on the road for two years.  He has dual American/Euro citizenship which made me insanely jealous because he's allowed to work in any country in the EU.  On the boat I met two English sisters who had moved visited Ko Tao 6 months ago and just decided to stay.  They had come back to the mainland to buy rabbits who they named Gary and Neil.  The rabbits were so awesome, the most chilled out bunnies I've ever seen.  Gary kicked in my pocket and fell asleep there.  He is awesome, and I plan to go visit him at the bar where the girls work later today.![Gary and Me](http://halfblackhalfamazing.files.wordpress.com/2009/09/img_0703.jpg)
