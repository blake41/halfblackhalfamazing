I just wanted to note that I am really curious what it is like to be a gay person in China or the rest of Asia.  As far as I saw, there aren’t really any gays in China.  This is clearly false, but I’m wondering if they are very repressed and not as flamboyant as in America, or all relegated to certain areas?
