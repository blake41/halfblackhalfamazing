We agreed to join the other group of young people led by a kid from London and stay at Spicy Lau, a small guesthouse they had already booked.  However, when we got there they only had six person dorm rooms for way too expensive so we decided on another guest house closer to the center of town and told them we’d meet them at the bowling alley (the only spot open later than 1130PM) later that night.  We settled into our hotel and then went out for dinner and drinks.  At dinner I was absolutely beat from a long day on the boat but I powered through dinner, slammed a Red Bull, had one of the Enlish girls slap me across the face to wake me up and headed to the “disco” which closed promptly at 1130PM every night.  The place was surprisingly filled with only Laos people and apparently all the women there were ladyboys.  However, we got some drinks and had a great time dancing.  It was at that time that I thought I saw David Webb on the dance floor.  I didn’t have my glasses on so I put them on to be sure and to my amazement there he was in the flesh.  I nearly dropped my drink, ran off in the middle of a sentence and jumped on him.  It was a glooorious reunion.  After the disco closed we all rolled over to the bowling alley and met up with London’s crew.  (I don’t know why but at some point during the boat trip I had taken to calling everyone by their nationality).  Everyone was pretty drunk at the bowling alley so we just bowled and messed around for a few hours till 2AM when it closed.  Another epic night.
