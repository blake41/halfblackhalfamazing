Whatever you think about Barack Obama’s term so far domestically, my experience internationally has convinced me that he was the right choice for president.  The reaction you get when you tell people you are American now is met with excitement rather than disgust.  People still will tell you how much they hate George Bush but how happy they are that we elected Obama and what hope they have for our world.  This is true of every country and ethnicity I have run in to.  Particularly the Balinese people love Obama and every time I tell someone I am from NYC they say you are like Obama! Because of course we are both mixed race.  Even in Ubud, which is a very small rural town the people knew Obama and could barely contain their enthusiasm for Obama’s visit to Bali in less than a month.  Our rafting guide even pointed out the hotel along the river where Barack will be staying.  It fills me with pride again to be an American, and I hope I am doing a good job while I travel of being 1/10th the ambassador of this great country internationally that he is.

There are two things I have been struck by in Bali that have been reinforced by a number of conversations I have had with the locals.  The first is how happy and friendly the people are the second is how poor they are.  Every person I have met here wants to chat you up, learn your name, where you are from, what it is like.  Other than Bermuda, I can’t remember being in a friendlier place.  It is also extremely refreshing to see that people can still be happy, and say they love Bali, when they are so poor.  Living in America, and NYC, it is hard to keep sight of the fact that money is NOT everything, and that there is more to being happy than possessing a lot of it.  My time in Hawaii, and in Bali have reinforced that the ability to be happy is more of a choice than it is circumstances.  However, I can’t ignore the fact that both cultures are island cultures and have amazing weather and access to the beach 365 days a year.  Maybe the key to happiness is as simple as that.

Two conversations with locals have stuck with me.  The first was with my massage therapist when we were talking about my work, and her work, and I asked her how long she went to school for.  She has never been to school, and apparently only wealthy kids in Bali go to school as there is no free public school.  First I was impressed that with no access to formal education she had a pretty good mastery of the English language and spoke 3 languages to my 1 and a half.  It’s pretty amazing how much we take for granted in our access to free education, even with all the problems the American education system has.  The thought that one could be born into a situation and have no access to any system to better ones self through learning is mind blowing.  It certainly gives you perspective when I think of all the time and energy I spent growing up avoiding school, school work, and my education in general.  What a blessing I had that I did not appreciate.

The second conversation I had was with my waitress in Uluwatu after a day of surf.  We talked for about an hour about her life and my life.  She was telling me how she would love to travel and “go on holiday” like we do, but Balinese people do not have money for travel.  I think this might be one of the reasons that the local people are so curious to talk to you and learn more about where you come from.  They have no access to education, or information outside of their small island, and all are highly intelligent and curious people who take advantage of every opportunity to better themselves.  The recent advent of the tourism industry and Bali has brought tremendous opportunity for growth and learning about the world which the Balinese have taken full advantage of.     It’s hard to imagine a life without travel, especially one in which you are constantly surrounded and serving people more fortunate than you as they get to experience the magic of travel and the culture and wonder that is Bali.  To still be happy every day and live your life to the fullest given this obvious disparity is remarkable to me and inspiring.  The Balinese people have many traits which I aspire to emulate as I grow older.
