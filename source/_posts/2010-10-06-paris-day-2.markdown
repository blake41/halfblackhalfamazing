Woke up late and did a long walk towards Notre Dame and the little thing on the hill.  Notre Dame is pretty impressive as to be expected, and just in general the cities architecture is magnificent, never seen anything like it.  Around mid day my sickness really started to drain me so we sat down for a minute and then decided to take the metro to our destination.  We hopped out and climbed up a big hill and at the top got a pretty spectacular view of the city.  After that we headed home and took some naps before meeting up with Herbert and Meg for the Spain world cup game.  I was still so exhausted that I had to bail and go back to sleep and skipped dinner and then met up with them around midnight at some bars post dinner.  The 3 hour nap was necessary and I felt a million times better and we proceeded to crush some beers and shots and champagne at a Rugby bar as we ran into some of Russ' old friends who were Rugby players.  Then Herbert lost her necklace so Russ went to go look for it with her and we headed to some other bar that supposedly had a dance floor but it was literally all old dudes like 50's and so we went back to the front and got 4 beers and 4 shots for 80 EURO!  After that we headed home.
