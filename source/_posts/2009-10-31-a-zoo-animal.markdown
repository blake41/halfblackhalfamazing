It seems that in China, they don’t have the same cultural prohibitions on staring.  Everywhere I go I am met with stares and gawking.  I imagine I get this more than most westerners because I have dark skin and it’s probably pretty rare that they see a wealthy dark westerner travelling through their country.  However, it never ceases to amuse me how much people stare over here.  Also, usually in the states if you catch someone staring they will look away when they get caught.  However, over here, they just keep staring.  Pretty funny.
