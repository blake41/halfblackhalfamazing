As I travel I subconsciously expect every place I visit to be a substandard version of whatever we have in America.  And yet almost everywhere I go countries have better versions of things we have, or just straight up things that we should have, that we don’t.  In China, the availability of public toilets is remarkable.  How do we not have this in major cities like NYC?  I mean you can always run into Starbucks but they shouldn’t have to subsidize the entire NYC public.  The subways in Hong Kong, Shanghai, and Tokyo are remarkably better than in NYC.  They are cleaner, more often, and the signage is dramatically better.  Each platform has a sign saying the stop you are on, and the next stop in each direction, with the incorrect direction stop greyed out.  This makes it near impossible to get on a train going the wrong way, because you can see your stop greyed out.  The airports in KL, Shanghai and Mumbai all had free wireless all over the airport.  How do all airports not have this! Wireless at the airport is approaching a necessity.  The ability to change plans from the airport, rent a car, get a hotel, look up information are paramount when you are travelling.  It’s a crime that we don’t have this.  Also, the bullet train network in Japan, as well as the ability to use phones and the internet on the subway are remarkable.  Again, America is well behind in these respects.  That is a short list off the top of my head of things that other countries have gotten right, that we have not.  Can't wait to set up my Mao statue when I get back to NYC.
