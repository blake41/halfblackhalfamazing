Anyone who’s a regular reader may have noticed that the blog has gotten a little stale, with few updates since I got to Sydney.  The reason for that is I’m trying only to write about interesting things, and if I got nothing to knock your socks off with, I’m not going to write boring entries.  I know most of you are reading this from work and trying to get out of your cubicle briefly to live vicariously through you, so if my life is not more interesting than yours, I’m not going to bore you with sh*tty entries.  

That said, I’m writing this entry from 40,000 feet and will be back in Southeast Asia till I fly to Honolulu on October 28th so expect the blog to be back in full swing.  Also, I think I will have a friend joining me in Northern Thailand after I finish diving on Ko Tao.
