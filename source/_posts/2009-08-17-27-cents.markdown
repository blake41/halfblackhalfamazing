“27 Cents”.  This Was Carlos’ response to the question, if kidnapped, how much would you pay in ransom to get Blake back?  Always good to know you’re work is valued.  The last days at Abadi & Company were capped off by a little family photo session and some tearful goodbyes.  I told Merary and Emily that despite the fact that I am irreplaceable, I would send them pictures and stories from Asia to fill the icebox where their hearts used to be.  Thus this blog was born.  I hope to make this blog a combination of a diary of my thoughts, insights and observations as I travel, as well as a slightly humorous account of my comings and goings.  Hopefully I’ll be slightly more witty in print than I am in real life. Miss all you kids already.
