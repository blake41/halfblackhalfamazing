The overnight bus to Buenos Aires was cool, the longest ride I'd been on, and it kind of felt like all the people on the bus were on an adventure together.  I met a French girl who was studying architecture in BA for the past few months.  We chatted quite a bit during the ride and I got to practice my french which was surprisingly passable.  I got her email address and she invited me to join her at a jazz club called Thelonius in BA later that week.  

The minute I arrived in BA I knew I was going to love it.  The city feels alive and is really vibrant and beautiful.  Most of the buildings were built in the early 20th century when Argentina had a GDP equivalent to the United States so the architecture is all European, mostly French, and absolutely gorgeous.  The two main buildings are the "Pink House" where the President works, and La Congresso where the Congress works.  I'm staying at the Milhouse hostel on Avenida de Mayo, which is kind of amazing to me given that I imagine the price of a building on this beautiful main street must be quite large.  The hostel itself is pretty amazing.  Its 6 floors, and about 5 rooms per floor which at 8 people per room makes it about 250 people.  They also have another one down the road which is smaller.  It's quite the operation.  Inside there's a nice reception area and a huge bar/billiards/lounge area.  The bed is cheap here but the beers are kind of crazy expensive at 10 pesos per beer but since you aren't allowed to bring in outside alcohol you have little choice but to patronize the hostel bar.  

One of my first orders of business was to get drinks with Tim Katz, since he was down here with a Stanford Business School trip.  After meeting all the business school kids I can't say I'm dying to go to business school.  Apparently there's an expression "third chancers" which refers to kids who weren't cool in high school, weren't cool in college, and now are trying their hardest to be cool at business school, which is their third and last chance.  I was hoping since it was their last night that everyone would be dying to go out and dance all night but that was not the case.  We went to a chic bar, had some drinks and then moved to an irish pub before retiring around 2am.  I had a great time seeing Katz again, hearing about his trip to SEA and just generally catching up.  I also brought along a chill Canadian guy  I met in the hostel bar. [gallery orderby="title"]
