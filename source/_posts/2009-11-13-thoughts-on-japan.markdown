First off, I didn’t spend nearly enough time in Japan.  What a cool place.  I wish I had at least a month.  Also if you go, get the rail pass, it’s less than the price of a one way ticket to any major part of Japan but can only be purchased outside of Japan.  So it’s worth buying if you plan on taking even one bullet train ride as it allows you to ride unlimited for 7 days and if you use it even once you’ve already saved money.  I really wanted to go visit a friend of a friend in Kyoto but it was $260 USD for a round trip ticket which seemed crazy for just one day.  
One weird thing about Japan is that tons of people walk around with those Doctors masks on.  I know that SARS must have been a big scare for people over there but really it was years ago, what kind of way is it to go through life wearing a mask constantly.  It’s just ridiculous.  Why not lock yourself up in a giant bubble so no germs can come near you. Also I liked how the Japanese subway stops are numbered.  So you can look at the map once and know ok I’m at stop 3, and going to 9 so you always know how many stops away you are and whether your going in the right direction or if you’ve missed your stop.
I really want to get back to Japan and spend more time outside of Tokyo, and more time enjoying the nightlife.
