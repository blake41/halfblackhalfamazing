I think the highlight of my trip to China was flipping an old Chinese trick they have pulled on me 1,000,000 times back on them.  Let me be incredibly stereotypical for a minute here just to make a point.  I apologize in advance for anyone offended by this.  In America, and abroad, Chinese people will understand you when it is convenient for them, and five seconds later they know no English if what you are saying is no longer to their benefit to understand.  Well I finally got to flip this trick around at the hotel I stayed at in Shanghai.  Checkout was at noon, which I had neglected to inquire about.  I went downstairs at 1PM to checkout only to be told that I would pay a half day extra charge for being late to checkout.  However, this was told to me in pretty broken English, so I just keep staring at them like I did not understand and repeating the price 190 (the original price the hotel should have cost, because I was not paying an extra 95 RMB for one hour late checkout).  Eventually the woman became very frustrated and went to talk to her boss at which time suddenly the extra charge had been removed.  I canâ€™t tell you how good this feels.

I feel much better now.
