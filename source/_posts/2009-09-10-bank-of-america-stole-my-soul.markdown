This post is a rant so feel free to skip it.  I just have to get this poison out of my system.

I spent the past two days on the phone with Bank of America, approximately 6 hours and 100 dollars in cell phone credits to get "emergency cash" from Bank of America.  I haven't ever really been subjected to a customer service experience as frustrating as the ordeal they put me through.  You'd expect the emergency cash department to be a branch of the bank that catered to your every whim, given that if you're calling them, by definition, you're out of your home country, most likely without reliable phone service, internet, access to cash, scared, and time sensitive.  I was first put in touch with Visa who they told me could send me an emergency card in 24-48 hours, what a relief!  Only to find out after hours, that since I had a mastercard rather than a visa card, this was not available to me.  Then I got sent to mastercard who doesn't do emergency cards that allow you to withdraw cash...umm seriously?  What the fuck use is a debit card that you can't withdraw cash with?  They do do emergency cash up to 1500 USD.  Ok I can live with that for now.  Bank of America told me all they had to do was fax over the paperwork to mastercard, and i could call in a few hours and they'd tell me where to pick up the money.  Only when I called mastercard they told me what BofA sent them was a denied request for emergency cash?  Why the f*ck would they do that?  Back on the phone with BofA.  Oh you denied my request because there was a recent lost card...not sh*t that's why I'm asking for emergency cash! because I don't have my f*cking card, like why the f*ck else would i want emergency cash?  Oh now that I'm screaming at you you realized that's idiotic and you'll send me money?  Ok thanks, great, let's sort this out.  Oh my phone credit just ran out and I have to start this whole process over again.  Finally I reach Jean, who is the first person in the whole bank who seems to have any idea what I am talking about.  She arranged the money, and told me Mastercard would contact me in 20 minutes to 2 hours.  Unfortunately they didn't do that, but not BofA's fault on that one.  Called Mastercard in the morning only to be told that they would call BofA to start the request, NO, my request has already been approved, I am just calling to find out where I can pick up my money.  Oh there's a new file number with my approved request?  It's appended to the old file number?  Do you really think I care?  I just want my money.

Truly a remarkable service.  What if I hadn't had friends loan me enough cash to tide me over?  What if I didn't have a place to stay with friends where I wasn't paying up front?  How can you in good conscience run a system where it takes 6 hours on the phone and 2 days to wire someone emergency cash?  Jean, if you're reading this, none of this was targeted at you, you were amazing and so helpful, and saved me from drowning myself in Bondi Beach last night.  Thank you.
