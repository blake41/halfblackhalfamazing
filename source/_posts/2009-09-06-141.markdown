We were pretty sick of Kuta, so we looked into a nicer place in Seminyak.  We went to check out some private villas to see what they cost.  When I found out they were 320 per room for two rooms, I was sold.  Unfortunately, about an hour later, we found out that it was not local currency, but USD.  I went to talk to them about our little miscommunication and to see if they’d take 240 USD for the room which would be 60 a person.  They agreed to give it to us for 250, and we decided to keep it as it was one of the most insanely beautiful places we’d ever seen.  The place came with a maid, laundry, private pool, four bedrooms, open air bathroom, just absolutely stunning.
