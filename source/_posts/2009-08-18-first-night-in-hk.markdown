Got into Hong Kong at around 1PM on Saturday after being on planes since 5PM Thursday.  Long journey but the legs on Malaysia Air from Mumbai to Kuala Lumpur and then on to Hong Kong were awesome.  Watched the new Star Trek movie and almost finished High Fidelity which is phenomenal so far.  Hong Kong Airport is super modern and makes JFK look archaic.  They have free wi-fi (how do all airports not provide this in 2009?).  The airport express train cost about 10 bucks to take us to Hong Kong in about 27 minutes.  China has the whole high speed rail thing figured out.  How we don't have comparable transportation in the US amazes me.  Booked a hotel in "Central" called the Central Park Hotel.  Had a little bit of confusion with the front desk and they thought we wanted one double bed instead of two single beds.  Luckily we figured things out and were about to get single beds although I think they are sized for Chinese people as my feet hang off the edge.  The room we are staying in has got to be a practical joke.  It can't be more than 12 feet wide and 15 feet long.  There is a shower with all glass that is probably 5 feet from Leigh's bed and a toilet right next to it.  There is no door that separates the bathroom area from the room it is all just one room.  Suffice it to say that this is the closest I will ever get to being in a gay marriage.   We met up with Matt and Ann at the Peak Tram.  It was about 100 degrees in the line  and Matt soaked through his shirt while we waited about an hour in the line.  The wait was well worth it.  The cable car ride to the top of the peak overlooking Hong Kong was incredible, and the view from the top was one of the most stunning views I've ever experienced.  The Hong Kong skyline dwarfs New York's by such a large margin it's silly.  Each building is unique and they put on coordinated light shows on the buildings at 8PM every night.  We took some pictures and then headed back to the city to get drinks.  After a stop at the Globe bar (which was a Rugby bar straight out of London) we headed home to get some much needed sleep.  Great introduction to this phenomenal city.![Hong Kong Skyline](http://halfblackhalfamazing.files.wordpress.com/2009/08/mg_1816.jpg)
