After La Boca I went to Sugar bar with a couple of the guys I'd been hanging out with.  Sugar bar has 5 peso anything you want happy hour until midnight.  That's about $1.25 USD.  So we chilled there for a couple of hours.  Then we headed over to Bahrein which was having a drum and bass night.  One of the guys we were with was super into drum and bass and the hostel was going to be at the bar so I figured I'd check it out not knowing what drum and bass is.  For the record, drum and bass is really terrible music, in my opinion.  So after about an hour there, I was like I can't take any more of this.  We went outside and tried to find a few other options, but at that time I ran into one of the girls from the hostel, a beautiful indian girl with an english accent, basically my Kryptonite.  She convinced me to stay and hang out with her, which of course I acquiesced to.  I kicked it with her and her friends at the club for the rest of the night and then went home.[gallery orderby="title"]
