Let me start by saying this was the most insane night of my life.  

Liza Rosenbaum has family down in BA, so she invited me to come to an asado (bbq) at her place.  I went over there at like 9, and ate lots of meat.  It was a really fun time, beautiful house, great food, and great company.  They had tons of drinks so we were all drinking together and lighting fireworks and then had a little dance party.  I had to be back to my hostel by like 130AM.  I went outside to find one, but I couldn't get a taxi back to my hostel.  I needed to get back because there was a 2am shuttle to Pasha this club everyone was going to that i'd alread bought tix for.  And i made out with this gorgeous indian chick the other night from the hostel who i wanted to hook up with on nye at pasha.  So Liza's bro said they'd just give me a ride to Pasha when they headed to their party.  But in the meantime i started making out with her Argentinian cousin.  So I was like fuck pasha i'll just roll with you guys.  We drove like 2 hours at like 3 or 4 am to a rave outside the city in this huge park.  Everyone was on acid.  I had a great time dancing and fucking around with Liza's cousin, then she had to go home (she lives with her parents which was devastating) then at like 11am we headed home, but the dude who was driving was tripping balls and I was like I'm not getting in a car with this dude, but Liza was like you don't really have any other options, and she was right.  So we drove about an hour home before this guy turned onto the wrong highway, as in we were driving on a highway the wrong way and driving towards the cars going the opposite way.  So we're like swerving trying to avoid cars and shit and im like OMG this is how it ends.  Life flashes before me, accept that death is imminent, and somehow we don't get killed and are able to pull off the highway at some point.  I run out, find a taxi, and go home.
