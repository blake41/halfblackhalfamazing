Somehow I forgot to mention that we went to a restaurant called Habibi our first night in Hong Kong.  Matt said they had good food and there was a sign outside that said they had a free belly dancing show that started in 10 minutes.  The restaurant was middle eastern food (Egyptian?) and the show was really cool.  I got some sort of blue Martini which was terrible.  Oh well, you win some you lose some![Belly Dancer](http://halfblackhalfamazing.files.wordpress.com/2009/08/mg_1861.jpg)
