We decided to get out of Kuta and follow the advice of four French guys we met at our hotel and head to Ubud and then around the north east part of the island heading towards Padangbai.  Suffice it to say the last night in Kuta was crazy, and one of the most interesting nights on the trip but it won’t be discussed on the blog.
