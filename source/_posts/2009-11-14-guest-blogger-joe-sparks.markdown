Sunday November 8th,

Haubush, Ewa Beach Oahu

Rolling into the dirt parking lot Sunday morning the surf looked marginal at first glance.  As is usually the case, it looks better once you paddle out, and Haubush was looking as good as it gets.  Blake and I posted up just left of the main peak which was pretty crowded by local standards.  We sat on a peak that we pretty much had to ourselves with the exception of two stand up paddle board guys.  Lined up head high sets were rolling through and we got plenty of them... splitting peaks left and right (I'm regular foot and Blake is goofy).  I won't bore you with the detailed wave by wave recap but just know little Blakey was killing it.  I joked that when we went in people on the beach would be high fiving us and sure enough a guy approached us asking about our boards and where he could get one.  

Blake's note, joe is a man who embraces brevity.
