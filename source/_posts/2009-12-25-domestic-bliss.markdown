Maya left the next day and Herbert and I settled into a life of domestic bliss.  I spent the vast majority of most days on the internet and/or doing my Pimsleur Portuguese language tapes which are surprisingly good.  Highlights included meeting Herbert’s cousin Aline, her boyfriend and some of his friends and the Jockey Club, which is like Belmont but in the middle of Sao Paulo.  It has a nice restaurant/club inside from where you can watch horse racing, although for some reason they didn’t have any races on the Sunday we were there.  Afterwards we had Pizza Rodizio which means all you can eat pizza in a similar style to a Churrascaria.  They bring around pizzas with all sorts of pizza slices (they have about 40 styles including hot dog) and just keep coming round until you are satiated.  After dinner they come around with dessert slices which looked awesome (pictured below) despite the fact that I didn’t have any because they were all chocolate.  After dinner Aline gave us a tour of the city around the famous park Ibirapuera which was all lit up for Christmas and had a giant mechanical Christmas tree.  They also took us down the main street, Avenue Paulista, through the financial district where all the big stores had great Christmas displays and in the center of the street they had big lamp posts each with happy holidays in one of the worlds’ major languages.  It was awesome to get a tour of the city by car as it’s so large it’s the only real way to see it.  [gallery]
