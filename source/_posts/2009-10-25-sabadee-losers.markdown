On the tuk tuk ride back from tubing, it was pouring rain out, we were all freezing and huddled together in the tuk tuk.  This English couple, Dawn and some guy whose name escapes me joined us in the Tuk Tuk.  Dawn may have been the funniest girl I’ve ever met.  She made Susie party look like she has a stick up her ass.  Out of her mouth came a constant string of obscenities, my personal favorites being. Sabadee Losers, which she shouted to the tubers that were waiting for the next Tuk Tuk (Sabadee means hello in Laos), and when everyone was saying they couldn’t wait to get home and get in a hot shower, she said she just wanted to go home and FUCK.  Thank you Dawn, you made my evening.
