After Curitiba I headed to Iguacu Falls.  Most people go to the falls for a couple of days, but knowing myself, I planned on only a few hours.  I love natural beauty, but I just don't know how long you can stare at a waterfall for.  I caught an overnight bus from Curitiba to Iguacu which was a pretty terrible bus ride.  The woman next to me had to be at least 250 pounds, and rather than sleeping on her back in the seat like a normal person, she slept in the spoon position facing me.  This meant that her head was resting on my shoulder, and she was breathing on my face.  At different points during the trip, her hand would be resting on my leg.  I didn't know how to politely ask her, in Portuguese, to get off of me so I just suffered in silence.  Anyways, I rolled into the bus station around sunrise and headed to the falls by local bus.  The Brazil side of the falls are quite developed, there's a whole national park, and a bus that takes you to various points in the national park if you want to do hiking, or white water rafting or other outdoorsy stuff like that.  I just hopped off at the falls and did the hour long walk along the falls.  They really are quite spectacular.  There's so many of them and there's some metal walkways that have been built that take you almost into some of them.  I spent a few hours checking out the waterfalls and then headed back to the bus station to catch another overnight bus to Buenos Aires.[gallery]
