<div class="entry-content"><p>This day may have been the most difficult day I&#8217;ve faced so far on the trip.  If you&#8217;ve been reading this blog then you know that I lost my wallet in Bali.  I haven&#8217;t had an ATM card since then, just a credit card, and have had my roommates send me cash periodically.  When I was in China I noticed I was running low so I asked Russ to send me some cash.  I didn&#8217;t have time to pick it up in China, so I figured I&#8217;d just grab it when I got to Tokyo.  My hostel required up front payment for the 5 nights I was staying, so I had to give up about 13,000 Yen of my remaining 15,000 Yen.  Then after food on Friday night and Saturday morning I had about 1,000 Yen left.  I headed into the city to go to the bank where I could pick up the moneygram transfer.  When I got to the bank, it was around 2PM and I was told that because China was specified as the country where I could pick up the money, I could not pick it up in Japan.  I didn&#8217;t know it was country specific and begged the bank and then the moneygram people to give me the money, but apparently there was nothing that could be done.  Then I noticed my 1,000 Yen note had fallen out of my wallet, which meant I only had the coins in my pocket, which was about 50 Yen.  Its 190 Yen for a subway ticket.  The bank guy suggested getting a cash advance.  I walked to the subway to find a public phone, but couldn&#8217;t figure out how to use the Japanese public phones.  I walked back to the bank and asked if they&#8217;d let me use one of the bank&#8217;s phone to call my credit card company to see how to get a cash advance.  The manager took pity on me and let me use his.  My citibank said I could go to any bank with my ID and CC and get an advance.  Phew.  However the bank manager told me that no banks were open, and wouldn&#8217;t reopen till Monday.  So I had to borrow the phone again to see if there was an immediate way to set up a pin number.  There was, but I needed my checking account number for verification.  I had my checking account number, but it was back in my bag at the hostel.  Awesome.  So I had to get back to my hotel with only 50 Yen.  So I resolved to go beg for money in the subway.  Once I got in the subway I saw a Starbucks and figured if I could use their wireless I must have my account number somewhere online.  However, due to the language barrier they couldn&#8217;t figure out how to get me on their wireless.  So I was back to the begging plan, but at least I had a mango latte on hand.  I figured I&#8217;d wait for the first Westerner I saw, plead my case, and since I clearly wasn&#8217;t a bum begging for money, I was well dressed, clean shaven, had an American passport etc etc, I figured it&#8217;d be pretty easy.  I&#8217;m happy to report that the first person I asked gave me the money, and was really cool about it and was like hey I&#8217;ve been there before, don&#8217;t worry about it at all.  When I went to the ticket machine though, I realize I had done some math wrong, and was still 10 Yen short, so I turned to the Japanese girl next to me hoping she spoke English and asked for 10 Yen.  That&#8217;s like 1 cent so she was more than happy to help me out.  I finally got on the subway and made it back to the hostel.  I called citibank and got the pin number set up.  I went to 7-11 and used the ATM to get a cash advance, but it didn&#8217;t work!  Then I really started to freak out.  I went back to my hotel, called citibank and they told me there was a fraud alert on my card because someone tried to get a cash advance with my card in Japan.  That person was me I told them!  Oh ok all good now then!  Thanks citi!  I went back to 7-11 and finally got my hands on some cash.  Never felt so relieved to put bills in my wallet.[gallery]</p>
