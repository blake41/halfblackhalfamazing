<div class="entry-content"><p>Overall the trip to Hawaii was amazing.  After the insane last 3 weeks prior to reaching Hawaii, I really needed to relax, decompress, and recover from the grueling travel schedule I had put myself through.  By the time I had hit Tokyo, my social battery had been emptied, I barely talked to anyone in Tokyo.  I didn&#8217;t introduce myself to a single person in my hostel, I just didn&#8217;t want to talk to any more new people.  Staying in a nice house, with my own room/bed was just what I was looking for.  Seeing Joe again, getting to surf, meeting his wife was awesome.  Joe and Naoko both love to cook so we had gourmet meals pretty much every night.  All sorts of great grilled meat and fish and crazy sauces and stuff.  During the days we would get an early surf in at Haubush, the surf spot like 5 minutes from Joe&#8217;s place, and then Joe and I would work from home for the day.</p>

<p>It was also great to finally see all my old friends from Hawaii after two years away.  I got the Hawaiian Telcom crew together at Mai Tai&#8217;s, my favorite bar in the world, and saw my bartender friend Ed who is still there.  Got to see Ashley my old roomate, and Lisa my old pseudo girlfriend, Jack a guy I used to work/sail with.  The nights at Mai Tai&#8217;s were great, and I got as many of them in as possible while I was there.</p>

<p>We also had a great beach bbq at Ala Moana beach park with a bunch of Joe&#8217;s old employees and their friends who we used to surf with.  One of Naoko&#8217;s Japanese friends from SF, Satchko, stayed with us for like 3 or 4 days and she was a welcome addition as well.  She was really cool and liked to drink as much as the other three of us so it made for some long booze filled dinners at the house.  The only regrets of the trip were that we didn&#8217;t make it to North Shore to surf despite some great wave days, and didn&#8217;t end up going camping.  Other than that, some of the best weeks of the whole trip.   [gallery]</p>
