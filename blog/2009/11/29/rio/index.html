<div class="entry-content"><p>Rio is definitely one of the most amazing cities on the planet.  For sure my favorite with Hong Kong and New York a close second and third.  The energy in the city is incomparable to anywhere else.  The geography is unlike anything I&#8217;ve ever seen, a city built in and around mountains and more coastline squeezed into a small area than you can imagine.  It basically has tons of long arms like an octopus that jut out and create more beaches and coastline everywhere.  On top of that add the worlds most beautiful women who wear thongs to the beach and are as close to naked as can be,  a culture that celebrates music, rythm, dancing and partying and you have a city teeming with life and positive energy.  They estimate that on weekends there are 400,000 people on the beaches, and if you go to the beach you can barely move they are so packed.</p>

<p>The first night, we went to Porcao for dinner which was supposed to be the best Churrascaria in Rio and it lived up to it&#8217;s name.  The meat was incredible and we ate and drank for hours.  After that the first night going out partying started off really slow.  Since we were staying in Leblon, which is a really upscale neighborhood, there were few bars/clubs going on, but we couldn&#8217;t find anywhere better to go.  Finally someone clued us in to going to LAPA.  Usually the party in LAPA only goes off on Friday nights, but since it was Black Awareness day that Friday (a new Brazillian holiday) the party was going on Thursday and Friday night.  So we hopped in a cab and headed to LAPA.  The minute we got close I knew we had found what we were looking for.  LAPA has these big white arches and everything in the vicinity is just people dancing in the streets.  Street musicians banging on drums and everyone singing and dancing.  All along the main road there is just club/bar after club/bar with live music of all flavors.  After partying in the street for a while we picked a bar and started dancing.  We had an awesome time at the bar dancing to the live music all night.  At the end of the night we ran into the worst Brazillian custom I&#8217;ve seen here.  When you enter any club/bar they give you a card which you are supposed to hold onto all night.  The bartender will write on your card what drinks you get, so basically you are in charge of not losing your own tab.  If you don&#8217;t have your tab at the end of the night you are fucked.  Luckily I had all the tabs but Sivan&#8217;s and had not lost them so me Jenny and Maya were cool, but Sivan had lost hers and they someone had found it and put a bunch of drinks on it so she got f*cked.  At that point we didn&#8217;t care though and just wanted to go home.  We finally caught a cab and headed home.  We did a little late night skinnydipping and called it a night.</p>

<p>The next day we got a slow start but finally woke up, got food, and headed to Leblon beach which was about a block away from our hotel.  The beach scene was phenomenal, and we got an umbrella and chairs like everyone does here and just kicked it all day at the beach. The water was just cold enough to be refreshing and but warm enough to feel great. After the beach we caught a cab to the sugarloaf mountain and rode the cable car up to the top.  The view of the city at night was just breathtakingly beautiful.  It sounds cliche but Rio really is spectacularly beautiful both at night and during the day.  We headed back to the hotel, bought some quick food and drinks and pregamed in our hotel room.  After dinner we knew we wanted to go straight to LAPA for the Friday night party so we caught a cab that way.  The Friday night party in LAPA was even more insane than it had been the previous night. There was probably 50% more people in the streets.  We went into this African club which had this insanely cool drum/dancing performance.  Maybe 30 different kinds of drums and 10 women on stage doing such cool dances with crazy outfits on.  This is what I pictured Carnival being like.  After the performance we went back to the streets and ate street food, danced and drank all night in the streets.  After a long evening of partying we headed back to the hotel and went to bed.</p>

<p>The next day was Sivan and Maya&#8217;s last so we walked around Ipanema beach and did some exploring and shopping and what not.  At the end of the day we sent them off back to NYC and Jenny and I got some dinner at a pizza place near our new hotel in Ipanema and then took a cab towards Barra to check out Ilha dos Pescadores (Island of the fishes).  It was a cool spot but was empty when we got there around 9.  We talked to some people and they said to come back at midnight.  It was an interesting scene as the club was on a bridge kind of in the middle of a waterway, and there were a bunch of canals that headed out into the distance with houses on either sides of the canal.  We saw a small water taxi coming back towards shore.  We talked to a guy who spoke a bit of english and he suggested going to Sevino until the club opened.  We took the taxi through the canals to Sevino which was a bar right on the water.  We were pretty curious about the canals and the houses so we walked around the small alleyways for a bit trying to figure out what this community was.  Then we hit up Sevino for some drinks which was really chill.  We caught the taxi back to Isha dos Pescadores which had a big line out front but no music.  We waited about 15 minutes to see if there was live music but didn&#8217;t see anything going on.  We were both exhausted and wanted to get up early to go sightseeing the next day so we bailed and headed home.</p>

<p>The next day we did a favela (slum) tour.  It sounded weird that they&#8217;d have tours that go through the slums because to me it sounded like you were treating the poor like zoo attractions.  However, people had said we HAD to do it so why not.  Once you do it you realize that it&#8217;s in conjunction with the community as it&#8217;s a non profit organization that takes the money from the tours and runs schools and social programs in the favela so we were welcome there.  You also learn that the favelas are really safer than most of rio as the drug lords that run each slum forbid all crime as this brings the police into the favela which hurts business.  I felt remarkably safe and the favela itself was actually much nicer than I had envisioned.  City of God made Rio look soooo poor but in reality the favelas were not nearly as bad.  Half of them have sewage treatment and running water.  Not to say I&#8217;d like to live there, but it&#8217;s nothing like how poor people live in say poor parts of Southeast Asia.  The tour was really well done and informative because our guide was really well educated, had a law degree and used to live in Holland.  I&#8217;d recommend anyone who goes to Rio to do one.  After the tour we caught a train to the Christ statue which was incredible.  I feel like there are a lot of tourist attractions you go check out that don&#8217;t live up to the hype.  The Christ statue really does look like God is overlooking and protecting the city from on top of a ridiculous mountain.  The view from up top is awesome, even better than Sugarloaf Mountain and you really get a good sense of what the cities geography is.  After the christ statue I sent Jenny off and headed to a hostel for my last night.[gallery]</p>
