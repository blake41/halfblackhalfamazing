<div class="entry-content"><p>We got up at 2:30 AM to catch a taxi to a volcano to start our journey along the east coast.  We met up with our guides around 4AM at the base of the volcano and climbed about 2 hours up the volcano in the pitch black to catch the 6:20AM sunrise.  The sunrise/view was the most spectacular I can ever remember seeing.  You have 360 degree views of all of Bali and the sun rises just to the North of Angung mountain and is spectacular.  It’s also one of the few mountain sunrises I’ve seen where the clouds don’t block the views.  After we reached the summit they cooked us breakfast including eggs cooked using the volcano’s steam for heat.  Our guide, Made (which means second child in Bali) took us down the back of the ridge to see where the lava comes out of the crater and to the naturally heated hot   springs.  We checked out the hot springs but they weren’t that cool and not nearly as awesome as the hot springs I’d been to in Costa Rica so we passed and headed East.  We had a pretty interesting taxi ride as Mike and I chatted up our driver with regards to all the changes since tourism has hit Bali.  He said that since 1990 there has been tons of changes most notably that sex before marriage is much more acceptable than it used to be.  Our conversation started with a lesson on Hinduism and their versions of heaven and hell.  He said that if woman is promiscuous and has sex with lots of men she is not married to, in her next life she will be reincarnated and all her desires would be fulfilled by gigolo pig.  Gigolo pig is the name for a male pig who is kept just to impregnate female pigs.  If a male is promiscuous before marriage his penis will be burned off by a hot poker.  I was interested to note that female and male promiscuity is punished equally harshly and there isn’t the double standard that there is in the West.  He said in practice though, promiscuity outside of marriage has grown tremendously since the 1990’s as tourism, movies and western culture have influenced the culture in Bali.  Before 1990 women were not really allowed to be on the streets after 6pm, but now many work in hotels and get out later which began the change in dynamic.  He also believed that young children would see sexuality in movies, which caused them to want to satisfy their desires, that weren’t there before the internet and movies.  Now he says 50% of teenagers have had sex, whereas maybe 0 or 1 in 10 would have had before.  I had been told by someone in Hong Kong who had just returned from Bali that almost all women out at bars were prostitutes but our driver informed me that there are prostitutes but many women he called “naughty girls” who are just interested in trying different “styles” and that you don’t pay but they like Westerners and will sleep with them when they meet them at bars.  However, Balinese girls/women do not like to be kissed in public as this is highly frowned upon.  We finally finished our journey at Padangbai where were had planned to stay the night, but decided since we made it so early to just hop the ferry a day early and head to the Gili Islands.  We are headed to Gili Trawangan where there are no cars and many people have told me it was their favorite part of Bali.  It is a Muslim island and they are currently celebrating Ramadan so we are hoping it will still be a good trip.   I think we might splurge tonight since there is 5 of us and we have heard about some obscenely beautiful villas you can rent.  Our driver said if we go out it will be very easy for us to meet some “Naughty Girls” so we will see what happens.  On the ferry to Lombok right now should be in Gili by 9PM tonight.  Can’t wait.</p>
