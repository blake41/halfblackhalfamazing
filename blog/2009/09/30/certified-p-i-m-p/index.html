<div class="entry-content"><p>Hi friends.  The last few days have been pretty unbelievable.  I finished my PADI Open Water, Advanced Open Water and Nitrox certifications over the past 6 days.  Tomorrow I will be finishing my deep diving course which will certify me to dive up to the recreational dive maximum of 40 meters/130 feet.  I&#8217;ve done 10 dives over the past 4 dives and have loved each one.  I&#8217;ve learned peak performance buoyancy where they teach you to hover like buddha or hang upside down and generally float any way possible.  My instructor was this Japanese guy Kenji who was basically an underwater Samauri.  Hes done over 6,000 dives and his body is basically an extension of his will underwater.  He can even blow air bubble rings which at depth rise and expand into huge rings (pretty pimp skill).  Unfortunately it was too rough last night to do a night dive, so we did a wreck dive instead which was still pretty cool.</p>

<p>For anyone that&#8217;s never dove before, you should definitely think about getting certified, it&#8217;s a pretty amazing sport/hobby.  Also, if you&#8217;re going to do it, go to Ko Tao in Thailand.  It is hands down the best and cheapest place to get certified.  Crystal Divers is the resort I did it at and I would highly recommend them.  The instructors here have been great, both highly knowledgeable, really cool, and place a high premium on safety.  Lastly, because more people get certified on Ko Tao than anywhere in the world, it&#8217;s basically like an international party.  Everyone here is from somewhere different, and particularly the instructors and people doing there divemaster training here all are extremely interesting people.  I met a network engineer from Chicago who is 34 and decided one day he was done and left for Thailand to become a Scuba Diver.  I met two girls from Holland who are travelling the world while freelance writing for a magazine back in Holland.  They are currently writing an article about Asian men and the varying attitudes towards women which sounded fascinating.  The vibe on Ko Tao is super chill, friendly and international.  So many people come to do the open water and stay way longer.  Lots of people never leave; it is that kind of place.  Once you do your divemaster training here, you have free diving for life, so many people come back and kick it and dive.</p>

<p>One of the divemaster students I&#8217;ve been hanging out with&#8217;s name is Abrar.  He&#8217;s from Karachi in Pakistan and is 38.  He&#8217;s super chill and is nothing like what I would expect someone from Pakistan to be like.  He is not Muslim, and drinks although not excessively.  He quite his job in advertising 7 years ago and took his savings and started a production company.  Since then he has been making documentaries and reality adventure shows focusing on showing people what their potential is.  He&#8217;s been successful and has sold most of the shows to TV stations in Karachi.  He&#8217;s currently planning his next project which will take place most likely in Thailand and he is trying to sign Mountain Dew on as the branded sponsor.  He says he can produce the show for 200K and Mountain Dew is interested at 600K.  He says if he can do 5 or so shows over the next few years he&#8217;s done and will have achieved his dreams and is just going to travel for the rest of his life.  It was an inspiring story and I am going to keep him in my thoughts and try and send my positive thoughts towards things working out for him.  He&#8217;s also the one who took the underwater pic of me.  So many cool people here at the dive school, too little time.
