<div class="entry-content"><p>This post is a rant so feel free to skip it.  I just have to get this poison out of my system.</p>

<p>I spent the past two days on the phone with Bank of America, approximately 6 hours and 100 dollars in cell phone credits to get &#8220;emergency cash&#8221; from Bank of America.  I haven&#8217;t ever really been subjected to a customer service experience as frustrating as the ordeal they put me through.  You&#8217;d expect the emergency cash department to be a branch of the bank that catered to your every whim, given that if you&#8217;re calling them, by definition, you&#8217;re out of your home country, most likely without reliable phone service, internet, access to cash, scared, and time sensitive.  I was first put in touch with Visa who they told me could send me an emergency card in 24-48 hours, what a relief!  Only to find out after hours, that since I had a mastercard rather than a visa card, this was not available to me.  Then I got sent to mastercard who doesn&#8217;t do emergency cards that allow you to withdraw cash&#8230;umm seriously?  What the fuck use is a debit card that you can&#8217;t withdraw cash with?  They do do emergency cash up to 1500 USD.  Ok I can live with that for now.  Bank of America told me all they had to do was fax over the paperwork to mastercard, and i could call in a few hours and they&#8217;d tell me where to pick up the money.  Only when I called mastercard they told me what BofA sent them was a denied request for emergency cash?  Why the f<em>ck would they do that?  Back on the phone with BofA.  Oh you denied my request because there was a recent lost card&#8230;not sh</em>t that&#8217;s why I&#8217;m asking for emergency cash! because I don&#8217;t have my f<em>cking card, like why the f</em>ck else would i want emergency cash?  Oh now that I&#8217;m screaming at you you realized that&#8217;s idiotic and you&#8217;ll send me money?  Ok thanks, great, let&#8217;s sort this out.  Oh my phone credit just ran out and I have to start this whole process over again.  Finally I reach Jean, who is the first person in the whole bank who seems to have any idea what I am talking about.  She arranged the money, and told me Mastercard would contact me in 20 minutes to 2 hours.  Unfortunately they didn&#8217;t do that, but not BofA&#8217;s fault on that one.  Called Mastercard in the morning only to be told that they would call BofA to start the request, NO, my request has already been approved, I am just calling to find out where I can pick up my money.  Oh there&#8217;s a new file number with my approved request?  It&#8217;s appended to the old file number?  Do you really think I care?  I just want my money.</p>

<p>Truly a remarkable service.  What if I hadn&#8217;t had friends loan me enough cash to tide me over?  What if I didn&#8217;t have a place to stay with friends where I wasn&#8217;t paying up front?  How can you in good conscience run a system where it takes 6 hours on the phone and 2 days to wire someone emergency cash?  Jean, if you&#8217;re reading this, none of this was targeted at you, you were amazing and so helpful, and saved me from drowning myself in Bondi Beach last night.  Thank you.</p>
