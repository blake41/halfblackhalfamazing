<div class="entry-content"><p>When you go to Bali, everyone who has ever been there tells you to go to the Gili islands, but when pressed, it’s difficult for anyone to really tell you why or what you are going there to see/do.  However, the minute you arrive on the island, it’s immediately clear why you are there.   Where Bali is overrun with tourists, noise, mopeds, taxis, the Gili islands have no motorized transportation.  There is only one road that runs along the beach and horse drawn carriages speed by you with bicycle horns to alert you of their arrival.  The water is a gorgeous clear blue, and you are clearly on island time.  The beach is lined with cool restaurants with little huts and pillows for you to sit on.  There are really only two bars on the island, both on the beach and quite near each other, so when you meet people, there’s no need to get their number to meet up later.  Anyone who goes out on the island goes to the same place, either the Irish Bar, or Rudy’s.  Once we got to the island, some nice folks at a dive shop let us put our bags down in their shop and Adam, Leigh and Justin went to find us a hotel.  Mike and I decided to chill, grab some food and keep an eye on the bags.  While we were bullshitting with the dive shop employees, the idea came up that we could rent one of their ships that were sitting unused in the harbor as a hotel.  It slept 8, and we had 5, and all the food and drinks were included.  He figured he could call the owner and maybe get us a reduced rate off the usual price since we would just be sitting in the harbor rather than using fuel to travel per usual.  We negotiated a 400 USD per night fee and figured we’d check with the other guys to see if they’d like to do it for a night or two.  They were stoked on the idea, and we decided to rent the boat for 48 hours for 1100 USD and sail it to Nusa Lembongan which we were headed to anyways.  We figured since it included all food and drinks and accommodations it would really only cost 70-80 dollars a person more total and we’d have a 100 foot pirate ship to sail around for the next 2 days.  This was by far the best decision we made on the trip so far.  We rented a hotel for the evening and made plans to start our 48 hours at 1pm the next day.  Mike and I headed to the beach to chill and see if we couldn’t meet some people who would want to join us on the boat.  We met back up with the rest of the crew and headed out for dinner.  There’s a great spot right on the beach with these cool glowing orbs on wooden stumps.  The food was pretty good but the ambience was incredible.  After dinner we went to get drinks at Rudy’s bar.  We had heard that Gili might be pretty tame during Ramadan, but the bar scene was still pretty hoppin.  I can’t really imagine what Gili must be like when it goes off, but it must be awesome.  We met a group of 4 English girls who were chillin at one of the little huts on the beach and we played Kings with them or Ring of Fire as they call it.  We had a great time playing with them and invited them on a little tour of the Gilis the next day.</p>
