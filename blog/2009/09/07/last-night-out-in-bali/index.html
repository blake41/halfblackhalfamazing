<div class="entry-content"><p>The last night out in Bali was a pretty good time.  We started off the night with some great Sushi and then headed to a bar around the corner that was sort of a divey sort of bar.  One of the great ideas Balinesian clubs/bars have come up with is employing hot girls who are combination bartenders/hostess/just paid to hang out with the partrons.  Even though you know it&#8217;s their job to chat you up, who doesn&#8217;t like conversations with fun friendly people?  It makes the atmosphere of the bar just that much better.  American bars need to follow the lead on this one.</p>

<p>After the dive bar we headed to return our surf boards and ended up with a jam session at Toba&#8217;s surf shop.  Bain and one of the surf shop guys, (I&#8217;m blanking out on his name but I want to say Ro?) played guitars and me and Adam threw down some verses.  Apparently we were both singers in previous lives.  After that we headed towards vi ai pi which was hosting it&#8217;s grand opening and had free drinks.  It was kind of a weak scene so early in the night though so we checked out Joe&#8217;s Place which had Sound Rebel (a local Balinesian Reggae band) playing some great jams.  We sat and watched for about an hour and they played some great tunes.  I drank some Arak, a local rice based liquor, that is banned on Gili due to 26 people having died from drinking it.  My curiosity outweighed my usual distaste for risk and I tried some and really liked it.  After Joe&#8217;s Place we headed over to Sky Garden.  Sky Garden, per usual, was the hot spot and had a pretty good scene going on.  We watched some fire dancers, cruised around the different levels and then settled down on the dance floor.  I met a white girl who ran a surf camp in Bali, lived in Bali, and had just gotten divorced.  Unfortunately about 30 minutes after I met my ideal woman a bunch of Aussies got in a fight right next to me and I caught a beer bottle to the head which opened up a nice gash on my forehead.  I had to leave to go take care of it and so my night ended a little sooner than I would have liked.
