<div class="entry-content"><p>There’s something about zoos, and animals in general that I think brings out the kid in everyone.  As I rode the cable car up to the top of the zoo I passed over some elephants rolling around in the mud.  I literally laughed out loud.  There’s something about elephants that’s both awe inspiring and magical.  They seem so chill and human like they just make you laugh.  Being at the zoo made me feel like a kid again.  I can’t remember the last time I was at the zoo.  I wasn’t even sure what animals I have seen in real life.  Being at the zoo by myself was also awesome because I’ve never had the freedom to skip the boring animals, and just spend time with the cool ones because I’d always been taken to the zoo by a school trip, or parents who insist on it being an educational rather than fun experience.</p>

<p>The highlight of the Taronga zoo was without question, the lions.  Have you ever seen a lion up close in real life?  They are so f*cking badass I was jumping up and down in excitement.  There were two male and two female lions and at one point the alpha Male just starting roaring at the top of his lungs, which got all the other lions fired up and the other male joined in and then the females followed suit and all four of them got together and were just screaming their faces off.  It was so cool.  My second favorite animal was the Tiger.  It’s just an amazingly beautiful animal, although it just laid on it’s bed, must have had a big day.  The gorillas and monkeys were also really cool as it’s remarkable how human they seem.  They play just like little kids and just seem to be having a great time fooling around.  The elephants were pretty awesome, and it got me stoked to ride/play with some in Thailand and Laos.  I’ve heard the places where you can see them and play with them are pretty unbelievable and it got me really excited to get up close and personal with such an interesting animal.  It was also interesting to see Kangaroos as I’d never seen them before, but being zoo animals they were all pretty bored and just kind of laid there and didn’t really hop around like I had expected.  Lastly, the koala bear is the cutest animal on the planet.  Hands down.  I wanted to steal one and put it in my suitcase and just pet it forever.  What an awesome animal.</p>

<p>The aquarium was not as cool as the zoo.  There were a lot of pretty boring fish that seem to just be there because they are fish you’ve never seen, but very few were pretty or cool looking.  The highlights of the aquarium were the sharks which were really badass, the Manta and Eagle Rays (It’s incredible how big these guys are), and the platypus just because he’s such a silly looking little swimmer.
