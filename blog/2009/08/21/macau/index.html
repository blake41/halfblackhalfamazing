<div class="entry-content"><p>After the hike we took a cab back to our hotel and slept for a few hours to prepare for the evening ahead.  Matt and Ann invited us to join them in Macau (China’s Vegas) an island about an hour from Hong Kong by ferry.  They were staying at a friends Penthouse who was away for the weekend.  We got into Macau around 9, and got a pretty nice Penthouse room at the Sun Sun Hotel for about a hundred bucks.  Leigh bought a bottle of Johnnie Walker Red Label which we downed before meeting Matt and Ann and another couple at the Wynn for drinks.  The hotels in Macau were pretty incredible and in my opinion Macau absolutely dominates Vegas.  Just the fact that it’s an island vs. a desert would put it over Vegas, but the old Portuguese architecture of the city is awesome as well.  I’m not much of a gambler, but I decided that on this trip I wanted to try and have fun doing whatever the locals do wherever I am, so I figured I would pretend to like gambling for the evening.  We sat at a 100 HKD minimum blackjack table and immediately developed a great repor with our fellow tablemate and dealer.  Our tablemate’s name was Li and she was a 50 year old asian woman.  Our dealer was Connie who absolutely loved us and thought we were ridiculous.  For some reason no one in the entire casino was drinking which made us assume that there was no free drinks for gamblers like there is in Vegas.  We were quickly assured by Connie that we could have all the free drinks we wanted so we ordered some gin and tonics and a bunch of whiskey shots.  Leigh and I took out 2000 HKD (like 275 USD) and I proceeded to burn through it pretty quickly.  I burned through another 2000 HKD in about another hour and was completely wasted at that point.  I decided to cut myself off until Leigh convinced me to keep playing by giving me a 100 chip so I could play one last hand.  Luckily Leigh’s 1 chip loan allowed me to continue playing for another 4 hours.  We had an incredibly fun evening gambling and I think I may have to add gambling to my list of vices.  Li was an incredible team leader as she had the hot hand.  She probably pulled 11 or so blackjacks in the 6 hours we played (Midnight – 6AM).  I would say Li how are you feeling and she would do thumbs up if I was supposed to be big, or thumbs down if I had bad luck.  I would also ask Connie if she was feeling weak or strong and she would tell me how many 100 chips to bet.  Using their advice as betting indicators I went on a 10,000 HKD run and ended the night up 6,000 HKD (approx 750 USD).  We taught Li and Connie BAP and Bapped it out all night.  It’s hard to do the scene justice in words.  At 6am we finally decided to hit some clubs, but we didn’t realize how late it had gotten.  I think we tried to go to the Grand Lisboa’s club but were told it had been closed for hours.  At that point Leigh and I went and got late night fried rice and then called it a night.</p>

<p>The next day we tried to do a little tourist sightseeing in Macau but basically it was a bust.  We were exhausted and hungover and the sights in Macau were pretty weak.  I was going to bungee jump off the Macau Tower (which is very similar to the Space Needle in Seattle) but it was 1500 HKD which seemed pretty pricey to me. We caught the ferry back to Hong Kong and took a much needed nap.</p>
