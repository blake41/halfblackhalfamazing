<div class="entry-content"><p>Now that we have transportation and a good sense of the place I wanted to head to a better break.  Leigh decided to stay at Kuta Beach for another day to get back in the swing of things and I headed down south to Uluwatu.  I hopped on my moped for a drive that I was told would be about 45 minutes with no map and some vague directions from a guy we met at breakfast.  Driving a moped in Bali is insane but I am happy to report that I now can drive like a Balinese which means I am f*cking insane driver.  On the way back from Ulus I got the moped up to 100 km/h which is about 60 mph and was weaving through traffic.  So fun, and so stupid, but that’s kind of the point.  I got to Uluwatu without too much trouble although I made one wrong turn, parked my bike and walked down towards the break.  When I got to the break I was filled equally with two emotions: sheer terror, and pure joy.  The “town” that surrounds the break “Ulus” is built on a cliff about 200 feet up, and there are a bunch of rock piers you can walk out on and watch the waves break.  Ulus has got to be the most beautiful wave I have ever seen, even prettier than Pipeline on the north shore of Oahu.  I am goofy footed which means my natural wave breaks left and Ulus is all lefts.  The wave fires in constant sets and break in about 4 spots along a massive reef hundreds of yards long.  It took me about 30 minutes to work up the courage to paddle out and once I did I was so nervous I forgot my reef booties and sunscreen.</p>

<p>Ulus was really crowded but there was one break on the furthest left that was breaking slightly smaller with 75% less people so I headed that way.  The big set waves were coming in about 9 feet with a lot of water, comparable to anything I’d seen on Oahu except for Sunset Beach.  Let me interject here, is there anything sexier than seeing a hot girl paddle into the lineup and catch a win a wave over like 30 dudes?  That was a rhetorical question, the answer is no.  I finally got a wave about 30 minutes in about head high, made a nice drop in and was immediately ripped off my board by the lip of the wave.  The first few waves I caught the same thing happened until I realized I had to move down the first section a lot faster and started setting my board across the wave initially as I dropped in.  The highlight of the day was one of the hottest surfer girls I’ve ever seen paddling past me towards the big break.  I tried to make conversation with her but is any girl going to talk to a guy surfing the little break while she’s surfing the big break?  It’s like bringing a knife to a gunfight.</p>

<p>Scorecard:
45 minutes to Ulus
0 falls
1 drop in close out
3 drop in didn’t make the next section
2 long beautiful rides (priceless)</p>

<p>After about 3 hours we were well past high tide and the waves had dropped to about shoulder high I decided to paddle in.  I caught a wave in and headed towards the small alcove between the cliffs.  Unfortunately I hadn’t really thought out my exit as there was a strong current (approx 3 knots) that pulled you straight past the alcove.  I almost made the alcove but missed and almost got thrown into the rocks.  I started to paddle back out again but the current quickly dragged me much further past the alcove.  As I looked down the cliffs I couldn’t see any more beaches as far as I could see.  At this point I was one hundred yards past the alcove getting further and further away by the second.  A wave of pure panic passed over me and I started to paddle for my life as I realized that I was quickly going to get sucked out to sea and die because I was alone and no one would know to come looking for me.  Even at full strength I couldn’t make any headway back towards the alcove.  I realized I had about 30 seconds to do something before I was headed towards a likely sea death.  I sat on my board and tried to relax and think.  I looked towards the cliffs and saw a small section of sand about 3 feet by 3 feet.  I decided to paddle back out, catch a wave and take it at the beach.  I did just that and successfully made it to the beach.  I laid down on the beach absolutely exhausted and decided to rest for a while and figure out a plan.  At this point I saw a girl getting sucked past the alcove and started to panic that she was going to die as well.  She was about 300 yards past the takeout point so I quickly threw my board on the rocks and scrambled along the cliff to see if I could get her attention and help her.  I couldn’t get her attention and I decided I had to get back ASAP so I could get some help for her.  However, after watching her for 10 minutes I realized she was smart, and was paddling out to sea to get out of the current.  She finally made it out of the current and started making good headway back to the takeout point.  I then remembered that the tide was going out, and that my small beach and cliffs, would soon become a large beach and path to the takeout point.  I chilled out for half and hour and then anticlimactically strolled out.</p>

<p>After some lunch and picture taking I headed home ecstatic to have conquered Ulus and escaped with my life.  I met up with Leigh at Kuta Beach and then headed back to the hotel.  I got an hour massage at the same place as the day before and then met Bain and his two friends Adam and Mike and Leigh at dinner.  After dinner we decided to get some beers and hang out at our hotel’s pool which was open till midnight.  At the pool we met some gorgeous Russian girls who told us they were there in a big group from Moscow of about 25 people.  They were all really cool and a lot of them were on mushrooms.  We had a blast kicking it with them and Leigh fell in love with an insanely gorgeous girl Anya (of course).  I am in love with the girl who was kind of the leader of the pack of Russian girls although she has a boyfriend.  Went to bed at midnight with plans to kick it with the girls the next day at Kuta Beach or Dinner/Out.  One of the best days of my life.</p>

<p>-Juice Out</p>

<p>P.S. I have also taken up drinking tea, and smoking cigarettes and getting up early.  It’s pretty hard not to smoke when you are travelling internationally because all cute girls smoke and the easiest way to start conversation with them is to ask for a cigarette.</p>

<p>P.P.S. Leigh reported that he killed it at Kuta Beach catching about 25+ waves.  I am stoked about this because maybe he will stop being such a p*ssy and come surf real waves with me at some point this trip.  Aaaaand, after a whole day without sunblock I might be darker than Darnell now.</p>
