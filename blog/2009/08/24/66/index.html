<div class="entry-content"><p>Woke up at the crack of dawn so we could get a head start on the day as there was still much to do.  We walked down to the beach to check out the surf and it looked significantly better than we had been told it would.  We did a little shopping and picked up some local tank tops as that’s what everyone wears here.  We grabbed breakfast at our hotel and then went to try and find a more reasonably priced hotel.  For some reason in Indonesia hotels don’t really keep records of who is coming and going, so hotels are either full or have rooms, and the ones that are full can’t tell you when they are not going to be full.  So between 9-11AM during the checkout time, you walk around and stop at each hotel you see and ask if anyone has checked out.  If they have, it’s first come first serve.  We were lucky enough to find a hotel that after some badgering grudgingly admitted someone would be checking out that day and was willing to rent us a room.  It’s 120,000 R a night (12 USD) for a nice hotel with a pool, a room with two beds, shower, fan and Lanai.  Pretty unbelievable deal.  We then rented mopeds from the hotel which are 35,000 R a day plus 10,000 insurance.  They come with solid surf racks that allow you to go on the highway with a board.  The perfect means of transport.  Luckily, while we waited for the mopeds to arrive, I was reading a copy of Lonely Planet that was laying on the table which clued us in to the fact that we needed drivers licenses.  So we headed to the police station to get licenses.</p>

<p>The police station was quite an adventure.  The cops spoke the worst English of anyone we had yet met on the island and we finally conveyed that we needed licenses.  We were offered the option of a paper license, or a card, the paper for 100,000 R each, or the card for 400,000, so of course we went with paper.  We filled out forms that seemed to be a stolen property report but were assured they just needed our information to process the license.  When it was all typed up it finally dawned on us what was going on.  They were selling us a signed affidavit from the police station which said our international driving permits had been stolen the day before.  This affidavit allows us to drive as long as we want here.  What a great system.</p>

<p>Now that we had transportation we loaded up the boards and headed to the beach.  The waves were about shoulder high and really clean despite it being insanely crowded.  We headed out to one of the breaks on Kuta beach and charged in.  I caught 4 waves during our first session 3 of which closed out and one of which I rode all the way to the beach.  I was pretty pumped given that I hadn’t surfed in 2 years.  After a few hours we headed up to the beach to grab some food.  We looked for Daniel near the Ocean Beach Club were he said his rack was and sure enough he was there waiting to store our boards for us.  He then took us to a street meat vendor on the beach which had amazing local food for 15,000 R.  I got a hamburger with some kind of spicy sauce, lettuce, tomato, bacon and an egg on top, and Leigh and I both got a dish of friend rice.  Best meal I’ve had in a while and it cost 30,000 R.  Pretty insane.  Since Daniel was nice enough to look after our boards we were able to take a stroll down the beach to check out the breezies.  The women in Bali are truly insane.  From Europeans, to Aussies to the local flavor I have never seen such a collection of gorgeous women anywhere in the world.  I may never make it off this island.</p>

<p>Oddly, in Bali, the surf is only good around high tide which was around noon so it got progressively smaller all day preventing us from doing the afternoon session we had planned on.  Instead we walked across the street to the Ocean Beach Club which is a very modern resort style club.  They have big tables with couch/lounge style seating with a big pool and a big deck.  We lounged on the couches for a few hours while drinking the local beer Bintang which is delicious and well priced.  We headed to our hotel to get cleaned up and take a swim and met 4 pretty chill French dudes.  They weren’t surfers but gave us some good tips on what to see in the more cultural northern parts of Bali which we plan on hitting at some point.  We then headed into town to grab some Sushi.  We found an amazing sushi place that cost us less than 200,000 R for two people, drinks and a boatload of Sushi.  After dinner I decided to get a massage as they are only 50,000 R here!  Of course I fell in love with my massage therapist again.  Her name was Ayu, was from Bali and was so beautiful.  The massage was amazing and I tipped her 50,000 R bringing the total cost of an hour massage to 10 USD.  Ayu told me to come back tomorrow which I most certainly will be doing.  I also am planning on taking her out to dinner so I can ask her to marry me.</p>
