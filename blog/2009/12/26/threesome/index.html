<div class="entry-content"><p>Our domestic bliss was interrupted when Herbert’s friend from law school, Suraj, joined us in Sao Paulo.  He had just finished his law school semester abroad in Buenos Aires and came to hang out for a few days.  We did a walking tour of the city checking out the tallest building in Sao Paulo, Edificio Italia, which is 43 floors high, and gives an amazing view of Sao Paulo.  You don’t really get a sense of how massive the city is until you’ve seen it from above.  It literally expands as far as the eye can see in all directions.  After that we checked out the Museum of Sao Paulo which was pretty lame with the exception of a cool graffiti exhibit.</p>

<p>Friday night we decided to hit the town hard so we made a big batch of Caipirinha’s and got some food.  Herbert passed out before we made it out so Suraj and I made plans to meet up with some kids from the hostel at a club not too far away.  When we got to the street it was a pretty sketchy street and it seemed like there was one club and everything else on the street was a strip club.  We decided to hang out with a street vendor we meet and ended up drinking on the street for hours and didn’t get into the club until 4AM.  By the time we got in the club we saw the hostel kids on their way out and most of the girls had cleared out of the club.  We had assumed the clubs would be open all night but we clearly miscalculated.  So we bounced out of the club and looked for somewhere else to go.  All the other places we went into were really broke scenes so we decided to go into a strip club to pass some time before heading home.  We planned to hang out at this strip club for probably just one drink but something bizarre was going on and we couldn’t tear ourselves away.  There were stripper poles all over the strip club, but no one stripping.  There were guys hitting on the strippers but they all acted uninterested, and were even more unapproachable than your average girl getting hit on in a normal bar.  We couldn’t figure out why the strippers would not want customers’ attention, either to sell lap dances or whatever.  It was honestly the most bizarre thing I’ve ever seen.  We tried talking to some of the strippers in my broken Portuguese and Suraj’s Spanish but we couldn’t get anywhere.  Finally, we decided to leave and I saw an American in the line to leave.  He explained that we were in a whorehouse, and there was an upstairs room where you could take the girls to have sex.  So apparently the whole thing is like the girls play hard to get and flirt with you a little bit to mirror the real chase and then they finally acquiesce and you pay them to sleep with you?  Still confused about this whole setup, but it at least makes more sense than what we had before.  <br/>
