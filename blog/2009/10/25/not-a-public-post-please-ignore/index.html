<div class="entry-content"><p>It&#8217;s a great thing when you realize you still have the ability to surprise yourself.
-Lester in American Beauty</p>

<p>“I am not going to sit on my ass as the events that affect me unfold to determine the course of my life. I’m going to take a stand. I’m going to defend it. Right or wrong, I’m going to defend it.”
-Ferris Beuler</p>

<p>There&#8217;s got to be a better way to do it.
-David Webb (Laos)</p>

<p>My goal in life is sustained awesomeness
-Brett Martin (From Italy)</p>

<p>Get paid in dollars, spend foreign currency
-Tim Ferris</p>

<p>Create more value than you capture
-Tim O&#8217;Reilly
Two movies that describe what I don&#8217;t want from life.  American Beauty &amp; ??</p>

<p>Trends and Interests
The internet
mobile phones
ubiquitous connectivity
Democratization created by the decentralization of the internet
Convergence between offline and online lives.  Use online tools to make better decisions in the real world.
Outsourcing, low wage workers access to internet, what business models does this open up that were unavailable 6 months ago.  Think mechanical turk.  Think automated translation.
location based services</p>

<p>Problems I&#8217;ve seen
Make optimal decisions in foreign cities
-Get from airport to hotel
-Pick a hotel in such and such area, is this the cool area to stay in?
-Search by location, written for young people not politically correct
-Not miss out on awesome stuff locals know about</p>

<p>Interests
-Photography
&#8211;People don&#8217;t want to buy your photographs, they want to create their own, and do it better.  Facilitate self expression. See tumblr. Give people the tools to be excellent and live unconventional lives.
-Dating
&#8211;How easy it was to meet Denmark and close.  The key to dating/meeting people is shared experience.<br/>
&#8211;People don&#8217;t want things to feel contrived.  They want to believe in love like in the movies.  They want it all to be &#8220;natural&#8221;.  How can you replicate the ease with which you meet people while you travel in normal life.<br/>
Test out if shared experience creates bonds in normal life like it does while traveling.  The key is to do things with people.  But what can we DO together.  You have to trick people.  What if you could run a dating service that was not branded as a dating service.  It&#8217;s a service for awesome people, who want to get together to do unconventional things.  What about surprises, don&#8217;t tell people what you are going to be doing.  Is it better to meet new people in an environment where you know no one?  Because you are forced to stop being lame and actually try.  Or is it better to allow people to have the security of someone they know so group dynamics can facilitate conversation and sucky people get brought along for the ride and can draft off the more interesting people in the group.  I&#8217;m leaning towards the former.  The reason it&#8217;s so easy to meet people when travelling, is because you replicate the experience of freshman year of college.  Nobody knows anyone, there are no pre existing cliques to break into.  Everyones guard is down, and not only is it down, but they are actively looking to engage people so they are no longer alone.  People seek to fit in.  Create a dynamic where they don&#8217;t fit in, and the goal is to fit in.  Incentivize them to talk to people.</p>

<p>Why at some age is the thing to do to stop having fun.  Do people really aspire to live conventional lives?  Am I really the outlier?  Or do all people secretly desire to live extraordinary lives, but are too scared to pursue that which might give them that.  If so, how could I give them the tools to live extraordinary lives.  Would people be interested in doing something out of the ordinary once a week to spice up their life?  Or would that just be &#8220;lame&#8221;.  Things that were fun at one point you start to look down upon.  Is this just natural, or does it give people a sense of superiority over others?  How do you get people to let their guard down and just have fun doing things that might not at first seem &#8220;cool&#8221;.  The key is to have a core group who is doing it who are &#8220;cool&#8221; who set the social norm so that people feel &#8220;uncool&#8221; sitting on their high horse and not participating.  Lead by example.  The hardest thing about meeting people is that you have nothing to talk about.  Facilitate the interaction by giving them something to do together first, and then after that they naturally have something to talk about, and people whom they both know that they can also talk about.  Why do some conversations end so poorly and some take off.  Isn&#8217;t it because you get lucky and hit upon something you both are comfortable talking about?  How do you eliminate that luck element and up the success ratio?</p>

<p>Two ideas: couchsurfing, but trading apartments.  Maybe start with just Europe to America.</p>

<p>Problems and solutions: use facebook identities so you can screen people.  Allow people to bank time anytime they go away. Will people let people they don&#8217;t know into their apartment? Use community to resolve this.  How can we verify that people are legit?
Business Model: Lead gen, tours, bus from airport, taxi to airport, attractions in cities. Free to list, charge to actually book someone&#8217;s place.</p>

<p>Blogging for dollars:  Use Adam&#8217;s company to generate donations so I can travel.  Offer people incentives to get me to do stuff.</p>

<p>use games to make things fun
http://grockit.com/</p>

<p>use communication to revolutionize business
offers to get paid</p>

<p>goals for my life
leverage
freedom, don&#8217;t like a set schedule or place (geographic and temporal freedom)
need social interaction though, don&#8217;t want to be alone by myself every day
want to surf and boat
make a difference, make peoples lives better
feel inspired
passive income
multiple sources of income
not pay rent
inspire people
travel</p>

<p>things people will pay a premium for
green/natural
tom&#8217;s shoes.  donate to charity
uniqueness, limited edition shit
crowdsourcing design or production</p>
