<div class="entry-content"><p>I left Vang Vieng at 1PM and hopped on the VIP bus which was supposedly a nice air conditioned tourist bus as opposed to the local bus which has hard seats and no AC.  However those sly foxes at VIP bus substituted a shitty bus for the one we were promised so we had no AC and the bus broke down.  Very clever business model.  Luckily it only took about 30 minutes to fix the bus, and they opened the windows making it not as much of an oven as it was when we got on the bus.  The ride to Vientiane was not nearly as beautiful as the ride from Luang Prabang to Vang Vieng but nevertheless it was enjoyable.  I was in a really sad mood as I had just left the crew I had been travelling with for the past 10 days which had basically become my family.  We stopped at a local spot along the way and I got a pretty decent chicken sandwich with some kind of spicy chili on it.  The highlight of the bus ride was the beginning when a really hot south American girl (I think) sat down next to me but she moved when she realized her seat was broken and didn’t recline.<br/>
We arrived in Vientiane around sunset and I took a public tuk tuk to the center of town and went to check my email.  The English girls let me know where they were staying so I headed to their hotel to grab a room.  They had chosen a pretty pricey hotel but I found a cheap room on the top floor which was just a fan room which was oppressively hot but doable for the 6 or so hours I planned on being in it.  They had a nice AC room with TV and cable so I kicked it with them for the night.  We decided to try and get a little culture on the trip through Laos and see one of the traditional Laos shows at the cultural centre, but we couldn’t find the building by the time it was supposed to start so we decided instead to go get some food and get a couple bottles of that famous Laos whiskey we had been introduced to in Vang Vieng and then hit the club.  We grabbed some friend rice and then went back to their room and had a great time playing kings (or ring of fire as English people call it) and drank two bottles of the Tiger whiskey.  By the time we left the room the three of us were completely in the bag and ready to dance our faces off.  The rest of the night was kind of a disaster and I am not going to get into it except to say it involved some beer tears that were not my own.
