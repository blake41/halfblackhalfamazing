<div class="entry-content"><p>Night travel has got to be one of the greatest things invented.  Not only are you transported while you sleep so you lose no time, you also don’t have to get a hotel for the night.  I spent less on the 2nd class sleeper car in my train than I did on my broke ass hotel the night before.  Additionally on both the night boat I took to Ko Tao, and the night train to Chang Mai, I met cool people.  What a great invention.  The sleeper trains in Thailand are amazingly nice.  Air conditioned (too cold actually bring warm clothes), super comfy and large beds, wall sockets for electricity, toilets, mirrors and sinks to wash up.  As many of you know I prefer couches to beds, this is basically my optimal living situation, and happens to be in a moving vehicle as well.</p>

<p>On the train there were two really cool French guys sitting across from me, Stephane and Majid.  I was curious as to where Majid was from as he looked similar to me but was French.  They gave me a little lesson on French history and explained that he was Algerian and what that meant in the context of France.  Learning something new every day.  Majid will be in Chang Mai about a week which is about what I will be there for so we made plans to go to Laos together.  Stayed up with them for a while just kicking it and exchanging stories about France vs. America and I tried to practice a little bit of my French.  Stephane was a news anchor for sports shows in France for many years and now he is doing TV production working on Polo currently and also used to (or still does?) do some journalism.  He was in Hong Kong for some meetings and then is taking a 2 week holiday, back to Hong Kong and then back to France.  Majid is an elementary school teacher who does half year teaching where you teach 6 months, then have 6 months off.  Sounds like a pretty awesome job, can I get that job?  He’s travelling for 4 months doing Thailand, then Bali, Sydney and I think one other place after that but I am blanking out.</p>

<p>The train should be arriving in Chang Mai shortly and I start my 3 day trek in about an hour.  Preity, the girl I met in Sydney will be joining me in Chang Mai when I return from my trek.
