<div class="entry-content"><p>I rushed to catch the ferry from Ko Tao to Ko Samui immediately after I finished my diving and it was a quick and pleasant ride.  Tons of people got off on Ko Pagnan for the full moon party but it didn’t sound even slightly appealing to me.  I went to the first beach bar I saw on Samui and used the internet to figure out a hotel and figure out where I was and relax with a beer.  I got a cab who promised to find me a hotel I would like for the right price for 300 baht.  Kinda pricey, but worth it.  I decided on the Hutcha Resort which was really nice, only 790 Baht and right on the beach.  I grabbed dinner and hit the sack early.  In the morning I woke up early so I could take pictures of the sunrise from the beach.  I was not disappointed.  The beach was gorgeous and the sunrise was amazing.  I also met an awesome dog, whose name I do not know as he was not wearing a tag, but I just named him Dawg.  We kicked it for a few hours on the beach taking pictures and fooling around in the rain and surf, it was a blast.  After that I booked a plane to Bangkok for that evening at 10, looked up an itinerary for the day, and rented a motorbike.  Cruising around the island by myself sans fellow travelers was great.  I could stop when/where I liked to take pics and didn’t have to worry about anyone else’s wants except my own.  The southern part of the island was spectacular.  I waded out into the water to get a bunch of great shots of the water, beaches and boats.  I visited Laem Sor Pagoda which was supposed to be a beautiful temple but turned out to be a pretty weak one.  Luckily I had had so much fun cruising around taking pictures that I was not disappointed at all.  I turned around and cruised back North to see the ice bar.</p>

<p>The ice bar has got to be one of the all time most gimmicky touristy things I’ve ever heard of, but I just couldn’t help myself.  It’s a bar in Chaweng beach that is -7 degress Celcius and completely made of ice.  It costs 375 baht just to go in and they give you a parka, gloves and fur hat.  The girls are dressed in furry white boots and school girl outfits and look amazing.  I got some cool pictures and bounced.</p>
