<div class="entry-content"><p>I had to get to the airport for a 9 oclock flight so I promised myself I’d be at the airport 3 hours early to make sure I wouldn’t miss another flight.  Billings suggested I check out the French Concession and it was a great recommendation.  It’s an amazingly beautiful part of the city, very European feel to the whole area.  I chilled out for a while at a nice park and just walked down the streets taking pics and chilling.  I headed back towards my hotel around 4PM feeling glorious and satisfied that I had conquered Shanghai.  After grabbing my bags I headed to catch the Maglev train.  The Maglev train is so cool.  Every major city should have one.  It takes 8 minutes to get to the airport using it and It maxes out at 430km/hr.  It’s pretty wild to zoom out of the city at that speed.  I got to the airport later than I had planned but still with plenty of time to catch my flight (7PM).  However, once I got there, I realized I had pulled the all time biggest boneheaded move of my life.  It turns out that there are 2 airports in Shanghai, and I was at the wrong one for my flight.  Amazingly, Shanghai airlines was able to get me onto a Eastern China Airlines flight only 40 minutes after my flight flying out of the airport I was at.  I assume they were able to do this because all the airlines are owned by the gov’t, but I was just shocked at how easily the problem was resolved.  I’m pretty sure in America I just would have been fucked.  The flight into Beijing went without a hitch and I arrive safe and sound at my hotel in Beijing after a short 100 RMB taxi ride.  However, once I got to the hotel I found out that Agoda.com who I booked the room through had asked that I fax them a copy of my passport and credit card as part of the fraud verification process.  Oh sure agoda.com let me grab the fax machine I keep with me and send it to you.  So I ended up paying over double what the quoted price was because supposedly it was the only room they had available.  It was 1AM and I was in no mood to go hotel shopping so I just checked in.  I had to give some help to my client so I was up till about 3AM working on that.</p>
