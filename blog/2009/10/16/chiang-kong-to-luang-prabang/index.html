<div class="entry-content"><p>The two English girls are, Louise and Nicola, two Danish girls, Emma and Tine, my friend Pim from Holland, two Aussies, Dave and Keith (who looks and sounds exactly like Jermaine from Flight of the Conchords).  We picked up one Sweede (sp?) in Chiang Kong.<br/>
The bus ride to Chiang Kong is amazing, truly beautiful landscape, exactly how you imagine it will be.  Rice fields and just greenery as far as the eye can see.  Chiang Kong itself is pretty budget.  There is very little to do, and the guest houses aren’t the nicest, but for the one night stopover it’s not the end of the world.  We ended up going to a small bar and playing pool and having some beers.  In the morning we got on the “slow boat” which is a long skinny boat with a top and benches on either side of the boat going all the way back similar to pews in a church.  They sell ice cold beers in the back for 15,000 Kip which is about 2 bucks or you can bring all the alcohol you want on board if you so choose.  You travel down the Mekong river into Laos for two days and one night and it is just breathtakingly beautiful.  There were about a hundred other people on the boat in addition to the group I had been travelling with, including two Americans and a group of about 30 people in their 20s.  About 10 of them had been travelling similarly to my group together since Chiang Mai.  A few from London, Germany, Canada, and others in Europe I don’t remember.  After a few couple of hours, beers were broken out, and the boat got significantly more lively.  We moved the benches around in big circles and got some cards out and starting playing asshole and this horse racing game the other Americans knew.  This was probably the peak of my experience travelling so far.  Being on this boat with so many cool people from so many countries and getting to know them all while floating down a river with spectacular scenery was just perfect.  We played games all day and kicked it and rolled into Pak Bang just in time to catch an incredible sunset.  Our crew all got rooms at a cheap guest house and headed to grab some food.  When we walked into the restaurant that the hotel owner led us too it was completely dark.  Then they flipped the generator on and music and lights and everything came on.  Pretty amusing.  We ordered a bunch of food and they even had an ipod hookup for their sound system so I threw some jams on.  The meal came with free whiskey so we indulged and kicked it for a few hours.  A French girl joined us at the tail end of our meal before heading back to the hotel to play cards and chill.  What a perfect evening.
The second day on the boat started off rough as we had been told the boat left at 10AM so we rolled up at 10 to 10 and everyone was on the boat giving us dirty looks.  Apparently the boat left at 9 so people had been waiting an hour for us to get on.  I’m kind of amazed that they didn’t just leave us there as there was no formal guest list or count of people with tickets.  We went to the back of the boat and didn’t have any seats and were cramped into a small room near the motor.  It was so loud but unsurprisingly the crew of young kids were all back there as well as they had gotten on late also.  We all ended up having another great day though as we were cramped and all could commiserate over the same fate.  The day was capped off by finding out who had stolen my whiskey.  The day before I had bought a liter of whiskey and it had disappeared right as we were getting of the boat when I went to the bathroom for a minute.  One of the girls from Denmark, Emma, said she saw who did it and pointed him out the next day.  So about midday I went up to him and asked him if he had taken a bottle of whiskey off the boat yesterday because my whiskey had disappeared.  He denied having taken it and he seemed like he was being truthful so I dropped it.  About an hour later he came to the back of the boat and told me he had taken it but it had been near a bunch of garbage and we were all leaving so he thought someone had forgotten it.  He had bought me a beer as a gesture of good faith and I was more than happy that he had been a stand up guy about it so I bought him a beer as well and all was well with the world.<br/>
