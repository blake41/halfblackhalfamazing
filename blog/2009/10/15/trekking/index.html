<div class="entry-content"><p>Let me start by saying if you go to Chiang Mai you HAVE to do the 3 day trek.  It was my favorite experience in Thailand so far.</p>

<p>I woke up early to get packed and prepared for our trek which started at 930AM.  Our group consisted of two guides who went by the names Tiger and Tarzan, two Austrian girls, an Australian couple, a Spanish couple who lived in Shanghai, one Army guy from Holland, and myself.  Quite the international crew.  We took a30 minute drive in a van to a local market to pick up supplies like water etc and then headed for the mountains.  We hiked for probably two hours uphill crossing multiple rivers and then had a break for lunch.  Lunch was rice and chicken and some spices and was quite tasty although it didn’t satiate my hunger.  We hiked for about 3 more hours and arrived at one of the Karen villages where we would be spending the night.  The villages are called “hill tribe villages” and they don’t speak Thai or English each village has it’s own language.  Tarzan and Tiger were from these villages and they had lived in Bangkok for a few years to study.  They told us that girls who were not married by 25 were “a very sad story” (one of their favorite expressions and now a group joke) and boy not married by 30 were also a very sad story.  Women who were unmarried were called white dress women because they wore a white dress.  All people from the village were virgins until married which included Tarzan despite the fact that he has two girlfriends in Chiang Mai one of which he lived with for four years.  This seems like quite a lot to handle for very little payoff.  Both of Tarzans parents lived in the village that we stayed in and they cooked dinner for us which was delicious green curry and rice.  They had beers and water in a big cooler and we just wrote down what we drank and were allowed to pay in the morning.  There was a bunch of houses in the village which were built on stilts and we had one big house/cabin for the tour group with small mats and mosquito nets.  The fun of the trip began after dinner as beers were drank, inhibitions were lost, cultural barriers bridged and lots of stories exchanged.</p>

<pre><code>Tarzan told us that in Thailand they have three kinds of Ladyboys.  Beautiful ladyboys were the best looking and the ones who had had the full operation.  Regular ladyboys were beautiful but had not had the operation, and buffalo ladyboys.  None of us had ever heard of buffalo ladyboys so of course we were all very curious.  Tarzan told us in his thick Thai accent, you know Usain Bolt?  In 2012, if you want me to win the Olympics against Usain Bolt, put buffalo ladyboy behind me and he chase me and I run faster than buffalo ladyboy.  So basically buffalo ladyboys are very big manly ladyboys.
In addition the whole evening Tarzan and Tiger were smoking opium along with their mother, so as we got more drunk their stories got even more and more racous although I won’t recant them as they were definitely you had to be there stories.  On the whole though the night was a blast, our group bonded and we all had a great time.  Unfortunately the two Spaniards had to leave at 6AM the next morning, which was quite remarkable to me because Tiger was leading them in the morning and he stayed up all night smoking opium.  They were doing the two day trek so they basically compressed everything we would do over the next two days into one day.  Pretty glad I did not do the 2 day and instead had chosen the three day.

<p>The next day we woke up late around 10-11AM and had eggs and toast with jam for breakfast.  We set off on our trek to the waterfall where we’d be staying for the next evening.  This day of hiking was much more fun as we all knew each other better now and had a great time hiking through the jungle together.  We stopped at a village for lunch and Tarzan cooked us some great soup.  I met this little boy who did a little photo shoot with me.  I’m not sure if he’d ever had his picture taken and seen the results but every time I showed him a picture of himself he’d squeal with delight.  He was so much fun.  After lunch we hiked for a few more hours and reached the waterfall by dusk.  The waterfall was beautiful and the water was the perfect temperature for a bunch of sweat soaked travelers and we all quickly donned our bathing suits and jumped in.  It felt amazing to stand under the power of the waterfall and have yourself cleaned off after a long hot day of hiking.  At the waterfall they a bunch of tiny little bungalows that were perfect for one or two people each so the Australians and the Austrian girls shared huts and Pim and I (the kid from Holland) had our own bungalows.  Tarzan made us another excellent dinner of rice and green curry, we lit a bunch of candles on a picnic table and I taught everyone how to play Asshole, Euchre, and Bullshit.  Everyone loved asshole and we had such a blast as the guys ended up president and vice president first which started a lot of shit talking until the girls finally took over power and then per usual the country vs. country shit talking added to the dynamic.  It was a great evening and by the end of the night I felt like I had known the group my whole life.  The highlight of the evening was when Julia (pronounced Yoo-Lia) screamed out FUCK YOUR ASS which she thought was something you’d say in English because we use the word fuck for just about everything.  We all fell on the ground laughing for minutes after hearing this tiny blonde girl scream that at the top of her lungs.<br/>
We had another leisurely morning the following morning getting up around 8AM for eggs and toast.  We walked a few hours to a town where we got picked up in a truck and taken to a small restaurant for spicy noodles and chicken for lunch.  That was followed by a one hour elephant trek into the jungle.  I am in love with elephants.  They are such amazing animals and I still can’t get over how big our elephants were.  The Australians (Rikki and Kieran) had a massive elephant probably between 12-14 feet while the rest of us got elephants that were about 10 feet tall.  Pim and I had a rogue elephant and he pretty much would go wherever he wanted rather than sticking to the path.  At one point he started climbing this hill that must have been climbing a 60 degree incline and I was terrified that he would slip but they are amazingly stable even with two big guys on their backs.  There are a bunch of huts along the ride where they sell bananas to feed to the elephants.  They stick their trunks over their backs and you hold the bananas out and they grab them with their trunks.  It is so cool.  The little Thai guys who would sit on their heads and direct the elephants where to go also would sort of purr at them and the elephants would respond by sort of making a sound like a motor which was really cool.  There were also tank of water along the way and the elephants would drink water and spray it behind them trying to soak you on top of them.  Pretty funny trick.  It’s definitely an experience where you worry that the elephants are abused and have a bad life all for the enjoyment of tourists but this did not seem to be the case.  They only had two riders on them and seemed to be very close with the guys who drove them and weren’t overworked.  Pim told me when he was in Sri Lanka the elephants had to carry 8 people on their back which seemed pretty terrible.  Anyways, I hope the elephants are happy, they seemed to be but I haven’t known that many elephants in my life so I have little basis for saying that.  The elephant ride was capped off with rafting down the river with two bamboo rafts with 3 people on each and a guide steering each raft.  The river was probably 4-6 feet deep so we could jump from raft to raft and knock each other off and swim along with the raft.  It was a beautiful day and it was such a great end to the trip.  Unfortunately our fun was cut short when Rikki got her finger pinched between a rock and a raft and ripped her pinky fingernail off.  This brought our journey to an unpleasant end but her finger is all right now and it was not the end of the world.<br/>
