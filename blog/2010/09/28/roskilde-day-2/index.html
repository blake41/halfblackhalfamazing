<div class="entry-content"><p>We probably roused around 11AM and went to get food.  We all began to properly meet each other and all drew our spirit animals in marker on each other.  I was Sweden Shark, in honor of my favorite guy I met traveling, Forrest was Relaxing Giraffe, Emma&#8217;s was blobfish, Pernille was a Manatee, Tine was a Guinea Pig.  To get the day into gear Fo, Russ and Laessa (Pernille&#8217;s brother) went to play whiffle ball.  They brough the Scotch and beers and an American flag that we were wearing as a cape.   As people came to join the game for at bats, they were required to take a pull of scotch before their ups.  This was when we met this awesome German guy, Christoph.  Emma and I went to join them but couldn&#8217;t find them so instead went to the skate park which had dudes in wheelchairs (not handicapped) throwing each other off ramps.  When we returned to the camp Russ and Fo had made friends with the camp across the street from us (the Animal Camp) which was a bunch of hilarious characters, a bunch of Danes who all had animal costumes (Cockroach, Cats etc) and they were playing beer bowling where you have two chairs at one end and two at the other end facing each other at opposite ends of a &#8220;bowling lane&#8221;.  In between your chairs you have a beer can, and you roll a soccer ball at the other teams beer can.  There is a judge who is in charge of &#8220;punishing&#8221; people, which basically consists of handing out arbitrary beer penalties on a whim.<br/>

Leigh arrived from France to much fanfare at the camp and probably received a better reception than most of the rockstars on stage at the festival.  We were so pumped and he added some much needed energy to the camp.  He arrived just in time to see the nephew concert.  Nephew is a Danish rock band which started by some famous Danish comedian who decided he wanted to be in a band too.  I have never seen a crowd go so insane for a concert.  It&#8217;s kind of one of those things that&#8217;s a mix between national pride and love for the music.  The concert was by far the best I&#8217;ve ever been too, literally 60,000 screaming Danes going fucking apeshit for these guys.  We had a group of about 10 of us at the concert and we were just jumping around and screaming even though we couldn&#8217;t understand anything they were saying.  At the end of the concert they had some guest DJs who got lifted down and hung just above the stage by the giant crane.  People went crazy.  So funny that the best concert we went to we didn&#8217;t understand a word of.  After the concert we all went on various missions.  The four of us ended up at a Norwegian tent of about 15 people who were really chill.   One of us got naked in exchange for beers.  We sat and kicked it with them till about sunrise and then went to the DJ tent.  It was a camp that was set up like a house with a DJ booth cut into the front of the house.  They were a bunch of young Danes who were pretty chill and loved us New Yorkers.  After a long night we finally hit the sack.<br/>
