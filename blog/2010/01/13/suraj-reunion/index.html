<div class="entry-content"><p>Met up with my friend Suraj who I met in Brazil.  Went to watch some horse races which were unbelievably boring.  They don&#8217;t sell any alcohol which was quite a surprise given that we&#8217;re in Argentina.  After that we walked around the market a bit and then went to dinner around 10pm at a Middle Eastern Place.  We had some great beef, hummus and some other stuff that I didn&#8217;t recognize but it all was good.  A few bottles of wine with dinner and then we headed to a nearby lounge/bar.  It was two of Suraj&#8217;s friends, Mako a japanese girl, and Jim an America, his brother Viral who&#8217;s finishing up med school, and a couple from NYC.  The bar was decent and we left around 2am to meet up with Suraj&#8217;s Argentinian friends.  They said the bar we were supposed to go to was not fun and to get in the cars with them and come to something else.  We drove for like 30 minutes before finally arriving at some brothels.  We were quite disappointed to find out that this was what the whole big trip was about.  We tried to politely explain that wasn&#8217;t what we were looking for.  We then got cabs and met up with some other Argentinians Suraj knew who invited us to another party.  I was stoked when we got there as it was all locals and they were playing Reggaeton, which is basically a hip hop beat with spanish vocals.  It&#8217;s really fun to dance to and the party was awesome.  I met a girl who lives in Mendoza and who is going to take me hiking there.  We partied until about 8am and then finally caught a cab home.[gallery orderby=&#8221;title&#8221;]</p>
