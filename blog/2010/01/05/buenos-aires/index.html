<div class="entry-content"><p>The overnight bus to Buenos Aires was cool, the longest ride I&#8217;d been on, and it kind of felt like all the people on the bus were on an adventure together.  I met a French girl who was studying architecture in BA for the past few months.  We chatted quite a bit during the ride and I got to practice my french which was surprisingly passable.  I got her email address and she invited me to join her at a jazz club called Thelonius in BA later that week.</p>

<p>The minute I arrived in BA I knew I was going to love it.  The city feels alive and is really vibrant and beautiful.  Most of the buildings were built in the early 20th century when Argentina had a GDP equivalent to the United States so the architecture is all European, mostly French, and absolutely gorgeous.  The two main buildings are the &#8220;Pink House&#8221; where the President works, and La Congresso where the Congress works.  I&#8217;m staying at the Milhouse hostel on Avenida de Mayo, which is kind of amazing to me given that I imagine the price of a building on this beautiful main street must be quite large.  The hostel itself is pretty amazing.  Its 6 floors, and about 5 rooms per floor which at 8 people per room makes it about 250 people.  They also have another one down the road which is smaller.  It&#8217;s quite the operation.  Inside there&#8217;s a nice reception area and a huge bar/billiards/lounge area.  The bed is cheap here but the beers are kind of crazy expensive at 10 pesos per beer but since you aren&#8217;t allowed to bring in outside alcohol you have little choice but to patronize the hostel bar.</p>

<p>One of my first orders of business was to get drinks with Tim Katz, since he was down here with a Stanford Business School trip.  After meeting all the business school kids I can&#8217;t say I&#8217;m dying to go to business school.  Apparently there&#8217;s an expression &#8220;third chancers&#8221; which refers to kids who weren&#8217;t cool in high school, weren&#8217;t cool in college, and now are trying their hardest to be cool at business school, which is their third and last chance.  I was hoping since it was their last night that everyone would be dying to go out and dance all night but that was not the case.  We went to a chic bar, had some drinks and then moved to an irish pub before retiring around 2am.  I had a great time seeing Katz again, hearing about his trip to SEA and just generally catching up.  I also brought along a chill Canadian guy  I met in the hostel bar. [gallery orderby=&#8221;title&#8221;]</p>
