<div class="entry-content"><p>The journey to El Calafate was surprisingly good considering it was about 28 hours.  They played American movies the whole time except while we were sleeping, and i was seated next to a cool Kiwi, Sophie.  We chatted for a good portion of the trip and watched movies the rest of the time.  28 hours on a bus sounded horrible, but the terrain was gorgeous and passed by in a flash.  We arrived in Calafate and I invited Sophie to join me at America Del Sul Hostel.  The hostel picked us up at the bus station which was a nice little perk, and we settled into one of the most gorgeous hostels I&#8217;ve stayed in.  It had a giant living room with giant bay windows overlooking the mountains and lakes and had nice sofas and a big area for group dinners.  I decided to splurge and buy into that nights asado.  Right after checking in, Olivia and Mary, the Scottish and British girl who I had met at Independencia and disliked, waltzed into my room and we had one of those OMG what are you doing here moments!  I ended up getting to know them better and really liking them.  Mary was feeling under the weather so she took a long nap, but Olivia, Sophie and I all played cards and drank Quilmes and wine until late.  Sophie had to leave in the morning for El Chaltan and couldn&#8217;t find her memory card for her camera anywhere.  I knew I had seen it on my bed but couldn&#8217;t remember what I did with it.  Right after she left for her bus I found it in my wallet and was really happy as she had left in tears and I knew I&#8217;d be heading to meet her later that evening.  Olivia, Mary and I took a tour to the Perito Moreno glacier.  Definitely one of the highlights of my life.  I had no idea it would be so amazing.  The glacier is much larger than you can imagine going in and just gorgeous in the sunlight.  There are a ton of walkways that allow you to get really close to it and watch giant chunks of it break off and fall furiously smashing into the water.  Every time a chunk fell into the water it sounded like an explosion.  I had an awesome time with Olivia and Mary and they ended up being two of my favorites on the whole trip.  [gallery]</p>
