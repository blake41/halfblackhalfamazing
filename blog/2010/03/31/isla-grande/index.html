<div class="entry-content"><p>Isla Grande was just an incredible week.  The island is super chill, no vehicles, and really only developed on about a mile strip of beachfront on one part of the island.  You can take day boat trips to other beaches, or do long beautiful hikes along the coastline.  I had gotten to know Lex and Ben pretty well so we headed out on a 2 hour hike to Lopes Mendes beach which was supposed to be one of the top beaches in the world and it did not disappoint.  The hike was brutally hot, and exhausting but enjoyable nonetheless.  Once we got to Lopes Mendes we realized it was well worth the trip.  It is by far the most gorgeous beach I&#8217;ve ever been to, trumping anything I saw anywhere in Hawaii.  Just perfect deserted, long, deep white sand beach with the most perfectly clear aqua blue water to top it off.  We had a great day of just chilling on the beach, listening to my ipod, and reading.  After a great day we caught the boat back to our hostel and kicked it on the deck with beers and some food.</p>

<p>The rest of the week was pretty much a repeat of our first few days.  Boat trips to Lopes Mendes, super lazy days, and nights partying at the hostel.  I met a great new crew the last few nights that I was there.  Dan, Lucy, Gemma and Claire, all Brits and two Dutch girls whose names I&#8217;ve forgotten.  We all headed out to get dinner, and on the way, an insane rainstorm hit us, and the whole island lost power.  Crazy wind and rain started pounding us on the beach and we ran into town to find a pizza place.  We had a great dinner, Dan was one of the funniest guys I&#8217;d ever met, and Lucy told us a great spooning story: She was feeling lonely one week, so she called up one of her guy friends to arrange a &#8220;spooning&#8221; date.  Now first of all I&#8217;ve never had a date with a girl friend with the express intent of spooning and nothing more.  I mean who signs up for sexual frustration?  Anyways, the guys all hesitant about it all week, and is like trying to make up all these excuses.  I&#8217;m not sure&#8230;etc etc.  And finally he&#8217;s like Lucy I just don&#8217;t feel comfortable with this.  So she&#8217;s like what is the big deal with spooning?  And he&#8217;s like dude I just don&#8217;t feel comfortable sticking a spoon up your ass!  Record stops&#8230;.WHAT?!?!?! So if you missed that, somehow the whole time she was talking about spooning he thought she wanted him to stick a spoon up her ass.  Oh you Brits kill me.</p>

<p>After dinner we headed out to Aquarius, the hostel next to ours for a dance party which ended up being pretty awesome.  Unfortunately the rest of the stories from Ilha Grande are not fit for public presentation.[gallery]</p>
