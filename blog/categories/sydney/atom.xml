    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>I figured that coming to the end of the year and about the 3/4 mark of the trip it'd be worth doing a synopsis of everything that's happened so far.  At this point I've been on the road for a little more than four and a half months, having left NYC August 13th.</p>

<p>I've been to 33 "places", (meaning spots I've spent at least one night in) and 12 countries.  I think Brazil is the place I spent the most time at around 1 month and will add another 2 weeks in February.</p>

<p>Excluding the countries I actually visited, I've met fellow travelers from:</p>

<p>Sweeden
Denmark
Holland
England
Australia
Ireland
France
Spain
Bolivia
Scotland
Germany
Italy
Croatia
South Africa
Russia
Austria
Israel
Mexico
Bulgaria</p>

<p>Definitely the most common countries are Aussies by far, then English, Israel, then oddly Sweeden.</p>

<p>Next year I'll be in Argentina (Mendoza, Bariloche &amp; El Calafate (Patagonia)), back to NYC for one week at the end of January.  Then two weeks in Northern Brazil and Salvador, then making my way down to Rio for carnival, then to Peru for two weeks (Lima and Cusco for Machu Pichu) then finally home to NYC with a possible stop in SF for skiing and/or Austin Texas.</p>

    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>Not sure if this was reported in the American Press, but the morning that I left there was a giant dust storm in Western Australia that blanketed Sydney in an eerie rest dust blanket.</p>

    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>There’s something about zoos, and animals in general that I think brings out the kid in everyone.  As I rode the cable car up to the top of the zoo I passed over some elephants rolling around in the mud.  I literally laughed out loud.  There’s something about elephants that’s both awe inspiring and magical.  They seem so chill and human like they just make you laugh.  Being at the zoo made me feel like a kid again.  I can’t remember the last time I was at the zoo.  I wasn’t even sure what animals I have seen in real life.  Being at the zoo by myself was also awesome because I’ve never had the freedom to skip the boring animals, and just spend time with the cool ones because I’d always been taken to the zoo by a school trip, or parents who insist on it being an educational rather than fun experience.</p>

<p>The highlight of the Taronga zoo was without question, the lions.  Have you ever seen a lion up close in real life?  They are so f*cking badass I was jumping up and down in excitement.  There were two male and two female lions and at one point the alpha Male just starting roaring at the top of his lungs, which got all the other lions fired up and the other male joined in and then the females followed suit and all four of them got together and were just screaming their faces off.  It was so cool.  My second favorite animal was the Tiger.  It’s just an amazingly beautiful animal, although it just laid on it’s bed, must have had a big day.  The gorillas and monkeys were also really cool as it’s remarkable how human they seem.  They play just like little kids and just seem to be having a great time fooling around.  The elephants were pretty awesome, and it got me stoked to ride/play with some in Thailand and Laos.  I’ve heard the places where you can see them and play with them are pretty unbelievable and it got me really excited to get up close and personal with such an interesting animal.  It was also interesting to see Kangaroos as I’d never seen them before, but being zoo animals they were all pretty bored and just kind of laid there and didn’t really hop around like I had expected.  Lastly, the koala bear is the cutest animal on the planet.  Hands down.  I wanted to steal one and put it in my suitcase and just pet it forever.  What an awesome animal.</p>

<p>The aquarium was not as cool as the zoo.  There were a lot of pretty boring fish that seem to just be there because they are fish you’ve never seen, but very few were pretty or cool looking.  The highlights of the aquarium were the sharks which were really badass, the Manta and Eagle Rays (It’s incredible how big these guys are), and the platypus just because he’s such a silly looking little swimmer.

    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>Sydney is not a good place to go if you are looking for a crazy adventure.  The city is beautiful, and IMHO one of the best places to live.  The beaches are beautiful, the surf is good, and the city itself is vibrant and very accessible.  I think it’s a pretty good combination of everything I liked about living in Honolulu, and everything I like about New York.  While it isn’t the best at anything, it’s good at everything.</p>

<p>Unfortunately while I was in Sydney I was mostly here to work, get my Brazilian visa, and resolve my lost wallet crisis in Bali.  Despite my limited time to explore, I did get to do a few cool things in Sydney.  My roommate and a few of her friends took me kayaking in Rose Bay and we kayaked to some rocks where you can go cliff jumping.  The water is pretty icy cold as they are just finishing winter, but it was a beautiful 30 degree celcius day out and it was fun despite the cold water.  A good friend of mine from Hawaii also took me to one of her kickboxing classes.  If you’ve never done kickboxing before, you should definitely try it.  It’s both an awesome workout, and so much fun.  They had a great mix they played while you are doing it, finishing off with the Mortal Kombat song which got me so fired up.</p>

<p>All in all Sydney was a good experience, but by the time my time here was almost up, I was pretty ready to leave.  Sydney is great, but outside of the funny way people talk, and driving on the wrong side of the road, you forget you’re even “travelling.”  You feel like you are in any American city.  I know I’m going to get torn apart by all the people who love Australia, so I want to qualify this with the fact that I love Sydney, it’s just not that much different than America, and when it’s bookended by Bali and Thailand, it kind of pales in comparison as far as the foreignness and the magic of being in a new place.  I’d love to get back to Australia at some point to see the great barrier reef, do some surfing when it’s warmer, and explore more of the natural beauty of the country.

    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>One of the biggest things I was curious to discover, and experience first hand was racism in Australia compared to in the US.  One of the things I’ve always heard about Australia is how racist it is.  However, my experience was quite the opposite.  I felt more comfortable in Australia than in a lot of places in the US.  I also asked the Indian girl I went out with what her thoughts were and she didn’t think there was any racism in Australia.  I think that should be taken with a grain of salt given that she is a particularly attractive girl and therefore I would guess significantly less likely to experience racism no matter where she is.  I also asked two Aussies who were bankers, about my age, basically the same demographic as most of my friends in NY.  They felt that there was no racism, and if anything America was much more racist.  A Jewish American girl who was part of this discussion totally disagreed and felt that while she didn’t feel any overt anti Semitism she did feel like there was a lack of exposure of most Aussie’s which caused her to feel uncomfortable expressing her religion.  So there is my statistically insignificant sample of racism in Australia.  Take it for what you will.</p>
