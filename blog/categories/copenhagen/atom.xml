    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>The girls came with us to Tivoli which was cool but a major rip off.  We did one ride which was basically swings that spin around a really tall pole which gives you an amazing view of Copenhagen, a truly beautiful city.  Other than that we chilled on the green, walked around and had some churros basically just killing time before we had to head to the airport for our flight to Paris.</p>

<p>Arrived late at night and all crashed at Leighs apt, walked down the street to grab a beer and sample the Paris night life in the square right down from Leigh's apartment.  We then decided to walk towards Notre Dame and grab some wine and drink it by the Seine and Louvre.  Pretty chill evening and then Russ took me to his old neighborhood to show me the apt he and Suzie party used to live in.

    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>We roused slowly and made our way into town to get some sushi to see if we could start putting healthy things into our bodies and nurse them back to health.  After sushi, we did some laundry, went to the park for some wiffle ball, and generally just attempted to waste the day away.  Fo and Russ went to an internet cafe for coffee and catching up on "real life" while Emma and I went shopping in preparation for the nights bbq.  Pernille and Helene arrived around 7:30 and they cooked up some pesto pasta.  In addition we made peppers, salad, burgers, potato salad, and hot dogs.  A pretty epic feast.  Emmas rooftop is a luxury style with hardwood on the top running the length of the building along with wood tables and comfy chairs, lights and a propane grill.  It's pretty baller and I'm pumped to make good use of it this summer.  Tine showed up late to the feast around 11 with one of her friends Tove and we played a game of pass the pigs, drank a few bottles of wine and headed into her bedroom for some boce, jack daniels, and general mischief.  Emma and I passed out early because we were both sick.

    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>I woke up Day 4 having lost my voice and having such severe pain in my throat that it felt like someone had put a hot poker down my throat, not sure how that happened.  The camp was an absolute disaster and everyone felt like death.  We decided to bail on Day 4 of the festival and just head home early.  After getting some breakfast and water in us though, we felt a little bit better and decided just to hang around and participate in the destruction.  All around us, the festival came apart.  At around 5am that morning the "animal camp" across the street from us had put on the theme from the lion king and massacred their camp before exiting.  We used the whiffle ball batt to swing at just about anything that might explode in an interesting fashion, mayonnaise, tennis balls, wine bags, beer cans, etc.  We were all in that delirious post 3 day binge still hungover and feeling a little crazy haze that you sometimes get.  It was a pretty awesome morning capped by filling 5 gallon freezing cold water jugs and dumping them on members of our campsite who had fallen asleep or were caught unaware.  No no one had the energy to attempt any of the concerts despite a pretty good lineup for the last day, so we all played wiffle ball, ran around a bit, and then headed out in the early afternoon.  The devastation at the festival was pretty amazing.</p>

<p>We made it back to Emma's apartment a severely depleted crew and decided to go out for a quick bite.  I got pizza, and the rest of the crew got pasta from a new place that had opened up.  Everything was delightful and we made it back just as it started to get dark around 10:30PM.  We threw in wedding crashers and everyone passed out.

    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>Day 3 was more of the same.  Probably a noon wakeup, a little food, and then Kings of Convenience and Vampire Weekend.  Kings of Convenience was chill and we just sat in the grass at the back.  Vampire Weekend was really fun and somehow we lucked out and got right up at the front I think because we cut a ton of people who had been waiting in line.  After that we returned to camp for dinner and more wiffle ball.  Again we required a pull of scotch and bought 3 more cases of beer to start getting festive.  The American flag drew a lot of attention and a lot of Americans came by to take a few swings.  Met a bunch of cool people.<br/>

The highlight was a sportscaster worthy grab that I made where I jumped in the air over this guy but sort of clipped him with my shoulder.  I barely grazed him but he honestly acted like I had punched him in the face.  I apologized profusely and he ended up giving US HIS CASE OF BEER.  Still unclear how that one worked itself out.  We were also able to watch football on a giant screen while we were playing which was cool.  After wiffle ball we headed back to the camp for more beer bowling.  We got a good crew together and all headed out to see Prodigy who was supposed to be epic.  However when we got there, it kind of blew.  So we stayed for about 20 minutes and then set out to cause trouble.  I think Russ and I lost everyone somehow so we went to buy a bottle of Jack and go on some missions.  We ended up meeting two Danish girls in the line for booze and ended up hanging out all night with them.  One of them spoke fluent French so of course Russell fell in love with her and at some point I lost them and went wandering by myself and ran into Forrest at some point.  There was some early morning dance party going on so we tried to get into that but it wasn't really happening so we went and hung out at the DJ tent before crashing.<br/>

    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>We probably roused around 11AM and went to get food.  We all began to properly meet each other and all drew our spirit animals in marker on each other.  I was Sweden Shark, in honor of my favorite guy I met traveling, Forrest was Relaxing Giraffe, Emma's was blobfish, Pernille was a Manatee, Tine was a Guinea Pig.  To get the day into gear Fo, Russ and Laessa (Pernille's brother) went to play whiffle ball.  They brough the Scotch and beers and an American flag that we were wearing as a cape.   As people came to join the game for at bats, they were required to take a pull of scotch before their ups.  This was when we met this awesome German guy, Christoph.  Emma and I went to join them but couldn't find them so instead went to the skate park which had dudes in wheelchairs (not handicapped) throwing each other off ramps.  When we returned to the camp Russ and Fo had made friends with the camp across the street from us (the Animal Camp) which was a bunch of hilarious characters, a bunch of Danes who all had animal costumes (Cockroach, Cats etc) and they were playing beer bowling where you have two chairs at one end and two at the other end facing each other at opposite ends of a "bowling lane".  In between your chairs you have a beer can, and you roll a soccer ball at the other teams beer can.  There is a judge who is in charge of "punishing" people, which basically consists of handing out arbitrary beer penalties on a whim.<br/>

Leigh arrived from France to much fanfare at the camp and probably received a better reception than most of the rockstars on stage at the festival.  We were so pumped and he added some much needed energy to the camp.  He arrived just in time to see the nephew concert.  Nephew is a Danish rock band which started by some famous Danish comedian who decided he wanted to be in a band too.  I have never seen a crowd go so insane for a concert.  It's kind of one of those things that's a mix between national pride and love for the music.  The concert was by far the best I've ever been too, literally 60,000 screaming Danes going fucking apeshit for these guys.  We had a group of about 10 of us at the concert and we were just jumping around and screaming even though we couldn't understand anything they were saying.  At the end of the concert they had some guest DJs who got lifted down and hung just above the stage by the giant crane.  People went crazy.  So funny that the best concert we went to we didn't understand a word of.  After the concert we all went on various missions.  The four of us ended up at a Norwegian tent of about 15 people who were really chill.   One of us got naked in exchange for beers.  We sat and kicked it with them till about sunrise and then went to the DJ tent.  It was a camp that was set up like a house with a DJ booth cut into the front of the house.  They were a bunch of young Danes who were pretty chill and loved us New Yorkers.  After a long night we finally hit the sack.<br/>
