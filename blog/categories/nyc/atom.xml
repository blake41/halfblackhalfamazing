    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>I figured that coming to the end of the year and about the 3/4 mark of the trip it'd be worth doing a synopsis of everything that's happened so far.  At this point I've been on the road for a little more than four and a half months, having left NYC August 13th.</p>

<p>I've been to 33 "places", (meaning spots I've spent at least one night in) and 12 countries.  I think Brazil is the place I spent the most time at around 1 month and will add another 2 weeks in February.</p>

<p>Excluding the countries I actually visited, I've met fellow travelers from:</p>

<p>Sweeden
Denmark
Holland
England
Australia
Ireland
France
Spain
Bolivia
Scotland
Germany
Italy
Croatia
South Africa
Russia
Austria
Israel
Mexico
Bulgaria</p>

<p>Definitely the most common countries are Aussies by far, then English, Israel, then oddly Sweeden.</p>

<p>Next year I'll be in Argentina (Mendoza, Bariloche &amp; El Calafate (Patagonia)), back to NYC for one week at the end of January.  Then two weeks in Northern Brazil and Salvador, then making my way down to Rio for carnival, then to Peru for two weeks (Lima and Cusco for Machu Pichu) then finally home to NYC with a possible stop in SF for skiing and/or Austin Texas.</p>

    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>“27 Cents”.  This Was Carlos’ response to the question, if kidnapped, how much would you pay in ransom to get Blake back?  Always good to know you’re work is valued.  The last days at Abadi &amp; Company were capped off by a little family photo session and some tearful goodbyes.  I told Merary and Emily that despite the fact that I am irreplaceable, I would send them pictures and stories from Asia to fill the icebox where their hearts used to be.  Thus this blog was born.  I hope to make this blog a combination of a diary of my thoughts, insights and observations as I travel, as well as a slightly humorous account of my comings and goings.  Hopefully I’ll be slightly more witty in print than I am in real life. Miss all you kids already.</p>
