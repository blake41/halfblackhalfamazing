    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>I figured that coming to the end of the year and about the 3/4 mark of the trip it'd be worth doing a synopsis of everything that's happened so far.  At this point I've been on the road for a little more than four and a half months, having left NYC August 13th.</p>

<p>I've been to 33 "places", (meaning spots I've spent at least one night in) and 12 countries.  I think Brazil is the place I spent the most time at around 1 month and will add another 2 weeks in February.</p>

<p>Excluding the countries I actually visited, I've met fellow travelers from:</p>

<p>Sweeden
Denmark
Holland
England
Australia
Ireland
France
Spain
Bolivia
Scotland
Germany
Italy
Croatia
South Africa
Russia
Austria
Israel
Mexico
Bulgaria</p>

<p>Definitely the most common countries are Aussies by far, then English, Israel, then oddly Sweeden.</p>

<p>Next year I'll be in Argentina (Mendoza, Bariloche &amp; El Calafate (Patagonia)), back to NYC for one week at the end of January.  Then two weeks in Northern Brazil and Salvador, then making my way down to Rio for carnival, then to Peru for two weeks (Lima and Cusco for Machu Pichu) then finally home to NYC with a possible stop in SF for skiing and/or Austin Texas.</p>

    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>I just wanted to note that it has felt so great being the tallest person everywhere I go.  When I get on a subway, I’m at least a head taller than just about everyone on the train.  It makes me feel like a giant badass.  Just wanted to share that.  If you’re a short guy, come to China/Japan and feel like a baller.</p>

<p>The negative to this is all doorways are built like 6 inches to a foot shorter.  I've banged my head an innumerable amount of times.  You'd think you'd adjust to it, but you'd be wrong.</p>

    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>When I was at Vientiane international airport, they had a map where Asia was on the left side, and the Americas were on the East side.  It had never occurred to me before that Asia being the east, and us being the West were really arbitrary points of view.  Always interesting when you realize how codified a lot of your perspectives are.</p>

    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>On the tuk tuk ride back from tubing, it was pouring rain out, we were all freezing and huddled together in the tuk tuk.  This English couple, Dawn and some guy whose name escapes me joined us in the Tuk Tuk.  Dawn may have been the funniest girl I’ve ever met.  She made Susie party look like she has a stick up her ass.  Out of her mouth came a constant string of obscenities, my personal favorites being. Sabadee Losers, which she shouted to the tubers that were waiting for the next Tuk Tuk (Sabadee means hello in Laos), and when everyone was saying they couldn’t wait to get home and get in a hot shower, she said she just wanted to go home and FUCK.  Thank you Dawn, you made my evening.</p>
