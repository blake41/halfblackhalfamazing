  <div class="entry-content"><p>Ever since I went to Mexico when I was a Junior in High School and was too much of a p*ssy to try and kiss this girl who I had a crush on and who I later learned had a crush on me I decided I’d live with no regrets.  I’ve never wanted to regret either doing something, or being too scared to not do it (more the latter as it’s hard to control what you WILL regret doing).  However, the biggest regret I’ve had in a while has been missing my plane in KL.  It cost me about 400 USD because apparently the ticket I had was a promotional no refund whatsoever ticket.  I spoke to the supervisor of all of Malaysia airlines and he was still unwilling to budge whatsoever.  They couldn’t put me on standby because all their planes were overbooked.  I understood his position given that it was entirely my fault for missing my plane, not his.  I lost a night in Shanghai and 400 USD as a result of my stupidity.  For most of my life, my dad and I have argued over being late/early to things, me insisting that we were wasting time by showing up early.  I’ve taken probably 50 or so flights in my life, and have never missed one, except for one post green key one but that was unavoidable as I knew if I drank until 6AM it was highly likely I’d miss my flight and accepted that when I had my first beer.  Other than that though I roll into the airport at the last possible minute and always have gotten on my flight with no problems.  This is the first and last flight I will miss as I am conceding to my father that even a 49/50 hit rate makes the one I missed a higher cost than all the potential hours I’d lose by getting to the airport early for the rest of my life.  Losing out on a night in Shanghai and 400 USD was crushing, and I’d easily give up an extra hour for every flight I’d saved on the past 49 to have made my plane that morning.  That said, if it costs me 400 USD and one day to learn that lesson at 26, maybe it was well worth it.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>I left early in the morning from Vientiane in order to catch my flight to Kuala Lumpur.  I emailed my old friend from Dartmouth/Novack Café to let him know I was headed to Singapore and to make dinner plans for that evening.  However, I found out the Kuala Lumpur is in Malaysia and not Singapore!  Who knew.  It’s weird that I thought that, because I had looked at the map when I was coming East from India through KL and saw that Singapore was on the bottom of Malaysia, and knew I was in Malaysia when I stopped over in KL on the way to Hong Kong, but somehow I got the idea that it was in both Singapore and Malaysia?  Anyways dear reader, I can assure you that Singapore is a different country than Malaysia.<br/>
Other than that, I have very little to say.  I went to see this giant cave with a big gold statue out front that is used as a temple but it was pretty underwhelming.  On the whole KL was pretty boring.  The highlight of my time there was missing my flight and spending a whole day in the airport.  I met a Chinese girl who was on her way back from Australia and who lived in Beijing.  We ended up kicking it for like 6 hours and made plans to meet up when I got to Beijing.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>When I was at Vientiane international airport, they had a map where Asia was on the left side, and the Americas were on the East side.  It had never occurred to me before that Asia being the east, and us being the West were really arbitrary points of view.  Always interesting when you realize how codified a lot of your perspectives are.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>One of the guys I was travelling with, Sweeden, told me the funniest story I have heard in a long time.  He had been travelling with an Australian for about three months, through China and the Phillipines and finally Thailand before he met up with us on the border of Laos.  So he tells us this story about Ko Pan’Ang where they went out for a typical crazy night out there.  They return at like 3PM the following day, drunk out of their minds, on the back of scooters, with chicks driving them.  This is the last thing Sweeden remembers before complete blackout.  He meets up with his buddy much later that night, and his buddy is not speaking, and looks really morose.  He asks him what’s wrong and his buddy answers, “I fucked a man last night.” To which of course Sweeden wants to know if there’s some story, which of course there is.  He says he went home with this “chick” and “she” started giving him this fantastic blowjob.  After a while “she” tells him “she” wants him to fuck “her” doggystyle in the ass.  Which of course is unorthodox, but not unheard of.  So he’s banging her in the ass for a while and he reaches around front to give her vagina a little massage, at which point he finds two tiny balls, no penis though.  At this point it’s clear to him that he is boning a man, but he is about 80% of the way done, he figures he might as well finish the job.  So he does, and then he goes home and hangs his head in shame.  Thank you Sweeden.</p>

-Get from airport to hotel
-Pick a hotel in such and such area, is this the cool area to stay in?
-Search by location, written for young people not politically correct
-Not miss out on awesome stuff locals know about</p>

<p>Interests
-Photography
&#8211;People don&#8217;t want to buy your photographs, they want to create their own, and do it better.  Facilitate self expression. See tumblr. Give people the tools to be excellent and live unconventional lives.
-Dating
&#8211;How easy it was to meet Denmark and close.  The key to dating/meeting people is shared experience.<br/>
&#8211;People don&#8217;t want things to feel contrived.  They want to believe in love like in the movies.  They want it all to be &#8220;natural&#8221;.  How can you replicate the ease with which you meet people while you travel in normal life.<br/>
Test out if shared experience creates bonds in normal life like it does while traveling.  The key is to do things with people.  But what can we DO together.  You have to trick people.  What if you could run a dating service that was not branded as a dating service.  It&#8217;s a service for awesome people, who want to get together to do unconventional things.  What about surprises, don&#8217;t tell people what you are going to be doing.  Is it better to meet new people in an environment where you know no one?  Because you are forced to stop being lame and actually try.  Or is it better to allow people to have the security of someone they know so group dynamics can facilitate conversation and sucky people get brought along for the ride and can draft off the more interesting people in the group.  I&#8217;m leaning towards the former.  The reason it&#8217;s so easy to meet people when travelling, is because you replicate the experience of freshman year of college.  Nobody knows anyone, there are no pre existing cliques to break into.  Everyones guard is down, and not only is it down, but they are actively looking to engage people so they are no longer alone.  People seek to fit in.  Create a dynamic where they don&#8217;t fit in, and the goal is to fit in.  Incentivize them to talk to people.</p>

<p>Why at some age is the thing to do to stop having fun.  Do people really aspire to live conventional lives?  Am I really the outlier?  Or do all people secretly desire to live extraordinary lives, but are too scared to pursue that which might give them that.  If so, how could I give them the tools to live extraordinary lives.  Would people be interested in doing something out of the ordinary once a week to spice up their life?  Or would that just be &#8220;lame&#8221;.  Things that were fun at one point you start to look down upon.  Is this just natural, or does it give people a sense of superiority over others?  How do you get people to let their guard down and just have fun doing things that might not at first seem &#8220;cool&#8221;.  The key is to have a core group who is doing it who are &#8220;cool&#8221; who set the social norm so that people feel &#8220;uncool&#8221; sitting on their high horse and not participating.  Lead by example.  The hardest thing about meeting people is that you have nothing to talk about.  Facilitate the interaction by giving them something to do together first, and then after that they naturally have something to talk about, and people whom they both know that they can also talk about.  Why do some conversations end so poorly and some take off.  Isn&#8217;t it because you get lucky and hit upon something you both are comfortable talking about?  How do you eliminate that luck element and up the success ratio?</p>

<p>Two ideas: couchsurfing, but trading apartments.  Maybe start with just Europe to America.</p>

<p>Problems and solutions: use facebook identities so you can screen people.  Allow people to bank time anytime they go away. Will people let people they don&#8217;t know into their apartment? Use community to resolve this.  How can we verify that people are legit?
Business Model: Lead gen, tours, bus from airport, taxi to airport, attractions in cities. Free to list, charge to actually book someone&#8217;s place.</p>

<p>Blogging for dollars:  Use Adam&#8217;s company to generate donations so I can travel.  Offer people incentives to get me to do stuff.</p>

<p>use games to make things fun

  <div class="entry-content"><p>On the tuk tuk ride back from tubing, it was pouring rain out, we were all freezing and huddled together in the tuk tuk.  This English couple, Dawn and some guy whose name escapes me joined us in the Tuk Tuk.  Dawn may have been the funniest girl I’ve ever met.  She made Susie party look like she has a stick up her ass.  Out of her mouth came a constant string of obscenities, my personal favorites being. Sabadee Losers, which she shouted to the tubers that were waiting for the next Tuk Tuk (Sabadee means hello in Laos), and when everyone was saying they couldn’t wait to get home and get in a hot shower, she said she just wanted to go home and FUCK.  Thank you Dawn, you made my evening.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>I left Vang Vieng at 1PM and hopped on the VIP bus which was supposedly a nice air conditioned tourist bus as opposed to the local bus which has hard seats and no AC.  However those sly foxes at VIP bus substituted a shitty bus for the one we were promised so we had no AC and the bus broke down.  Very clever business model.  Luckily it only took about 30 minutes to fix the bus, and they opened the windows making it not as much of an oven as it was when we got on the bus.  The ride to Vientiane was not nearly as beautiful as the ride from Luang Prabang to Vang Vieng but nevertheless it was enjoyable.  I was in a really sad mood as I had just left the crew I had been travelling with for the past 10 days which had basically become my family.  We stopped at a local spot along the way and I got a pretty decent chicken sandwich with some kind of spicy chili on it.  The highlight of the bus ride was the beginning when a really hot south American girl (I think) sat down next to me but she moved when she realized her seat was broken and didn’t recline.<br/>
We arrived in Vientiane around sunset and I took a public tuk tuk to the center of town and went to check my email.  The English girls let me know where they were staying so I headed to their hotel to grab a room.  They had chosen a pretty pricey hotel but I found a cheap room on the top floor which was just a fan room which was oppressively hot but doable for the 6 or so hours I planned on being in it.  They had a nice AC room with TV and cable so I kicked it with them for the night.  We decided to try and get a little culture on the trip through Laos and see one of the traditional Laos shows at the cultural centre, but we couldn’t find the building by the time it was supposed to start so we decided instead to go get some food and get a couple bottles of that famous Laos whiskey we had been introduced to in Vang Vieng and then hit the club.  We grabbed some friend rice and then went back to their room and had a great time playing kings (or ring of fire as English people call it) and drank two bottles of the Tiger whiskey.  By the time we left the room the three of us were completely in the bag and ready to dance our faces off.  The rest of the night was kind of a disaster and I am not going to get into it except to say it involved some beer tears that were not my own.

  <div class="entry-content"><p>Have you ever seen the movie The Beach?  If so, that&#8217;s the closest I can liken Vang Vieng to the beach.  It&#8217;s in the middle of nowhere, like nowhere, and it&#8217;s just this oasis in the middle of the desert.  A true backpacker town if I&#8217;ve ever seen one.  No hotels that cost more than 10 bucks a night.  The pizza place in town has a menu that includes, meth and joints, no joke.  The town only got electricity 10 years ago and some enterprising young locals decided to build all these bamboo bars and rope swings along the river.  If you&#8217;re from Dartmouth, think Tubestock, on a scale you can&#8217;t fathom.  The highest rope swing is about 30 meters high, and the first one you do is about 10 meters high.  Each bar has its own rope swing, and they are all different.  Some are zip lines, some you can swing back and forth to achieve maximum height, and one bar has a giant shower tile coated slide that shoots you from about 7 meters high upwards into the river.  You rent tubes in town, and are supposed to tube down the river which takes about 1-2 hours total, but it seems most people don&#8217;t ever get past the 4th bar (mud bar).  The locals who work the bars have bottles tied to ropes they throw at your tube and drag you into various bars as you tube down.  Each bar has giant PA speakers that blast everything from European techno to American hip hop/rap.  This is by far the wildest party I have ever seen.  They also have free shots at each bar of the local Laos whiskey &#8220;Tiger&#8221; that also has snakes and bees in it at the bottoms.  The second shot I took of this stuff literally almost made everything come back up, it was truly vile.  The most surreal thing about the experience is that it&#8217;s clear that a lot of people come, and never leave.  People tatoo (in blue magic marker) all kinds of clever slogans on their body along with the number of days in a row they&#8217;ve been tubing.  I saw one that was over 300 which I hope was a joke, but I saw some that I heard were more legit around 97 days.  As it gets dark everyone ends up at mud bar.  Aptly named, mud bar has a giant mud volleyball court with about 6 inches of really gooey mud.  It also has various pools that are more like giant holes in the ground filled with water.  By this time people are pretty wasted and everyone is just throwing each other in the mud and covered from head to toe in inches of mud.  It&#8217;s such a fun way to end the day.    [gallery]</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>After 3 days in Luang Prabang we were ready to take off so we returned the bikes, checked out of our hotel and grabbed breakfast.  Sweeden insisted that we should take the local bus despite the lack or air conditioning so we headed to the South Bus Station.  Unfortunately they wouldn’t sell us local bus tickets, they insisted they only had VIP bus (the tourist bus) that cost 3 times as much.  So we decided to just start hiking south and try and hop on the local bus when it came by and get a ticket once on it.  I really had just wanted to take a minibus together but didn’t care enough to argue.  When none of this really panned out we flagged down a minibus and bartered with him till we got a 90,000 kip per person rate and we hopped in for a white knuckle five hour ride to Vang Vieng.  This ride was both the most beautiful and scariest ride I’ve ever been on.  You are rigint through the mountains on these incredibly narrow windy roads with a driver going way faster than he should narrowly missing traffic going the other way.  I couldn’t relax the whole time, but the scenery was well worth the craziness.  Arriving in Vang Vieng very soon.</p>

<p>If you ever go to Northern Thailand, and Laos, I recommend doing a trek, taking a minibus to Chiang Kong and the slow boat to Pak Bang/Luang Prabang.  You will meet so many awesome people and it is so easy and such a great time.<br/>
