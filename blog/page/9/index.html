  <div class="entry-content"><p>“A master at the art of living makes no distinction between his work and his play, his labor and his leisure, his mind and his body, his education and his recreation, his love and his religion - he hardly knows which is which. He simply pursues with excellence what he is about and leaves others to determine, whether he is working or playing. He himself always knows, he is doing both.”
—      Wilfred A. Peterson</p>

<p>“The goals we pursue are always veiled. A girl who longs for marriage longs for something she knows nothing about. The boy who hankers after fame has no idea what fame is. The thing that gives our every move its meaning is always totally unknown to us.”
— Milan Kundera, The Unbearable Lightness of Being
Also, if you haven&#8217;t read that book, READ IT.  I LOVE IT</p>

<p>And lastly:
“My research revealed that lucky people generate good fortune via four basic principles. They are skilled at creating and noticing chance opportunities, make lucky decisions by listening to their intuition, create self-fulfilling prophesies via positive expectations, and adopt a resilient attitude that transforms bad luck into good.”
-Apologies for losing who said this</p>

<p>I like to think of myself as having an incredible life, and am shined on by fortune at every turn.  Although I&#8217;ve never thought of it as luck in the conventional sense, this definition of luck sounds just right.  What a lucky guy I am.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>Rented motorbikes around 1 and headed to another waterfall. These waterfalls weren’t as spectacular but were still pretty cool.  You drive about 45 minutes out of the city, which was a great ride on the bikes.  However before we had even gotten 200 Meters out of the motorbike rental a giant tour bus swerved into out lane coming at us and we had to dodge out of the way.  Keith layed his bike down and hit the pavement pretty hard.  I was worried he’d broken something or totally scraped up his left side but somehow his glasses were unharmed and he was unhurt for the most part.  The bike was a bit messed up so we walked back to the shop and they fixed the gear shifter that was getting jammed and we were off again.  Once you get to the river you park your bike and take a longtail boat about 5 minutes up the river.  Spent a few hours hiking around the waterfalls all the way to the furthest one in the back which was awesome because it was just me Holland and Jermaine and no other tourists.  We did some swimming and headed back to grab some food.  Ran into Webb again and all headed back to town together.  Met up with the rest of the crew and we all went out to get food and drinks.  We had planned to go out but instead just went home to play cards and chill.  Finally heard from Preitty who can’t come to Laos because she couldn’t get an appointment for something she needed to do in Bangkok until the end of October so it didn’t make sense to come this early.  Kind of glad as it’s been so much fun travelling alone and meeting people.  Totally different dynamic then when you are with people.  I can’t believe how much I prefer rolling by myself with no obligations to anyone.  Been spending a lot more time alone these days then I am used to.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>Woke up pretty late as we were all pretty hungover and grabbed food and a tuk tuk to the waterfalls.  The waterfalls are pretty awesome.  The best one is 60meters but there are many at different points in the river.  They also have rescued Asiatic Black Bears that were awesome to check out.  They have this whole campus built for them and they just kick it.  They look like all they want is a remote and a few beers and there life would be complete.  Was pretty exhausted this night so I slept for like 4 hours after returning from the waterfalls.  When I woke up Pim and I went to get food with the English girls and Webb and made plans to meet the English girls at the bowling alley in a short time.  I had to do about an hour of work so I headed to the internet café to knock that out.  By the time I had finished my work it was almost 11PM and Pim and the English girls were curled up in bed watching TV.  I headed to the bowling alley solo but no one was there so I turned right around.  I ran into Denmark, Germany and Sweeden.  Denmark came to hang out with me down by the river.  There was a great little café situated right over the river that was closed so I grabbed a beer and we just chilled down by the river for a few hours.  It was so peaceful and relaxing, [gallery]</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>Hello loyal blog readers!</p>

<p>I&#8217;ve noticed on the blog stats that the readership seems to have huge peaks and troughs based on when I get a chance to update the blog.  I am constantly writing posts on my netbook while I travel, but don&#8217;t always get to update, so sometimes I&#8217;ll throw up 7 posts at a time to catch up, the blog gets a spike, and then trickles down as there&#8217;s no new posts.  So I just figured out how to queue up posts, which means now I&#8217;ll have a new post for you every day, unless I&#8217;m away from the internet for like a week, and if you&#8217;re reading that, you know that if I haven&#8217;t been on the internet for a week, I&#8217;m already dead, and it&#8217;s silly to keep refreshing your browser in hopes of new posts. So come visit me once a day to get your daily dose of my campaign to promote American idiocy abroad.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>We agreed to join the other group of young people led by a kid from London and stay at Spicy Lau, a small guesthouse they had already booked.  However, when we got there they only had six person dorm rooms for way too expensive so we decided on another guest house closer to the center of town and told them we’d meet them at the bowling alley (the only spot open later than 1130PM) later that night.  We settled into our hotel and then went out for dinner and drinks.  At dinner I was absolutely beat from a long day on the boat but I powered through dinner, slammed a Red Bull, had one of the Enlish girls slap me across the face to wake me up and headed to the “disco” which closed promptly at 1130PM every night.  The place was surprisingly filled with only Laos people and apparently all the women there were ladyboys.  However, we got some drinks and had a great time dancing.  It was at that time that I thought I saw David Webb on the dance floor.  I didn’t have my glasses on so I put them on to be sure and to my amazement there he was in the flesh.  I nearly dropped my drink, ran off in the middle of a sentence and jumped on him.  It was a glooorious reunion.  After the disco closed we all rolled over to the bowling alley and met up with London’s crew.  (I don’t know why but at some point during the boat trip I had taken to calling everyone by their nationality).  Everyone was pretty drunk at the bowling alley so we just bowled and messed around for a few hours till 2AM when it closed.  Another epic night.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>The two English girls are, Louise and Nicola, two Danish girls, Emma and Tine, my friend Pim from Holland, two Aussies, Dave and Keith (who looks and sounds exactly like Jermaine from Flight of the Conchords).  We picked up one Sweede (sp?) in Chiang Kong.<br/>
The bus ride to Chiang Kong is amazing, truly beautiful landscape, exactly how you imagine it will be.  Rice fields and just greenery as far as the eye can see.  Chiang Kong itself is pretty budget.  There is very little to do, and the guest houses aren’t the nicest, but for the one night stopover it’s not the end of the world.  We ended up going to a small bar and playing pool and having some beers.  In the morning we got on the “slow boat” which is a long skinny boat with a top and benches on either side of the boat going all the way back similar to pews in a church.  They sell ice cold beers in the back for 15,000 Kip which is about 2 bucks or you can bring all the alcohol you want on board if you so choose.  You travel down the Mekong river into Laos for two days and one night and it is just breathtakingly beautiful.  There were about a hundred other people on the boat in addition to the group I had been travelling with, including two Americans and a group of about 30 people in their 20s.  About 10 of them had been travelling similarly to my group together since Chiang Mai.  A few from London, Germany, Canada, and others in Europe I don’t remember.  After a few couple of hours, beers were broken out, and the boat got significantly more lively.  We moved the benches around in big circles and got some cards out and starting playing asshole and this horse racing game the other Americans knew.  This was probably the peak of my experience travelling so far.  Being on this boat with so many cool people from so many countries and getting to know them all while floating down a river with spectacular scenery was just perfect.  We played games all day and kicked it and rolled into Pak Bang just in time to catch an incredible sunset.  Our crew all got rooms at a cheap guest house and headed to grab some food.  When we walked into the restaurant that the hotel owner led us too it was completely dark.  Then they flipped the generator on and music and lights and everything came on.  Pretty amusing.  We ordered a bunch of food and they even had an ipod hookup for their sound system so I threw some jams on.  The meal came with free whiskey so we indulged and kicked it for a few hours.  A French girl joined us at the tail end of our meal before heading back to the hotel to play cards and chill.  What a perfect evening.
The second day on the boat started off rough as we had been told the boat left at 10AM so we rolled up at 10 to 10 and everyone was on the boat giving us dirty looks.  Apparently the boat left at 9 so people had been waiting an hour for us to get on.  I’m kind of amazed that they didn’t just leave us there as there was no formal guest list or count of people with tickets.  We went to the back of the boat and didn’t have any seats and were cramped into a small room near the motor.  It was so loud but unsurprisingly the crew of young kids were all back there as well as they had gotten on late also.  We all ended up having another great day though as we were cramped and all could commiserate over the same fate.  The day was capped off by finding out who had stolen my whiskey.  The day before I had bought a liter of whiskey and it had disappeared right as we were getting of the boat when I went to the bathroom for a minute.  One of the girls from Denmark, Emma, said she saw who did it and pointed him out the next day.  So about midday I went up to him and asked him if he had taken a bottle of whiskey off the boat yesterday because my whiskey had disappeared.  He denied having taken it and he seemed like he was being truthful so I dropped it.  About an hour later he came to the back of the boat and told me he had taken it but it had been near a bunch of garbage and we were all leaving so he thought someone had forgotten it.  He had bought me a beer as a gesture of good faith and I was more than happy that he had been a stand up guy about it so I bought him a beer as well and all was well with the world.<br/>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>This is a random sidenote but I found it interesting.  The Austrian girls carry around Schnapps with them wherever they go.  This is not the same thing as Schnapps in America that is sweet and really low percentage alcohol.  It is usually between 40-60 percent alcohol but can go up to 80%.  Every family makes it themselves and therefore can distill it to whatever percentage they prefer.  It’s made with fruit and alcohol and is distilled multiple times to get the desired percentage of alcohol.  The girls said there’s was over 60% and I believe them as it burns your throat when it goes down.  They drink it once a day and say it’s very healthy for you.  I think this is a pretty cool tradition.</p>

<p>Right now I’m in a minibus headed to Chiang Khong where you catch the slow boat down the Mekong river to Luang Prabang in Laos.  Rikki and Kieran have to stay in Chang Mai for 5 days to make sure her finger doesn’t get infected, the Austrian girl are going to do a few days in Chang Rai and maybe Pai and then head to Laos.  Me and Pim are in the minibus with two girls from Denmark who I had to embarrassingly ask what language they spoke there (hint: it’s Danish).  They asked me if it was true that all Americans thought that IKEA was the capitol of Sweeden and I said yes because I thought it was hilarious.  We also have an Aussie and two English girls although the Aussie is doing a land tour rather than the 2 day boat trip down the river.  It’s a good crew and I’m excited for the boat trip which is supposed to be gorgeous, and Luang Prabang which is supposed to be insanely beautiful.  Preitty couldn’t get a flight to Chiang Mai so is meeting me in Luang Prabang on Monday.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>When you think of Thailand, and Bangkok, one of the main things that come to mind is the sex industry in Thailand.  Everywhere you go you see older western men with young hot Thai girls.  It is so common that Thai girls think you are weird if you are not with a Thai girl.  When you walk down streets with lots of bars all the Thai girls run into the street and grab your arm and try and drag you into the bars.  It’s a pretty strange phenomenon.<br/>
We started the night with dinner at our hotel with the Austrian girls and then went to a bar where we drank beers and played pool and darts.  I had a blast kicking it with the Austrian girls, learning some words in Austrian and laughing about their funny English.  We walked around for a while, got massages, had some drinks at some bars with some Thai girls and then headed to Spicy Bar which Pim had been to before the hiking trip and said was pretty wild.  Spicy bar lived up to it’s name.  It’s filled with Thai girls and westerners.  Contrary to what you would think, the girls are not prostitutes but seem to generally like Western guys and go home with them for free just like in New York!  Pim and I had a pretty wild night and he left with a girl probably around like 4AM but I was up until 7AM dancing and partying all night.  I met a Thai girl, haven’t a clue what her name was and we kicked it all night.  There was some other dude who seemed to be her boyfriend that she was dancing with all night as well.  At the end of the night she took me outside and explained that this dude was not her boyfriend, but was jealous and pissed because they were friends and he has a crush on her but she doesn’t like him like that.  Just like America again!  At this point it was 7AM, fully light out, and she wanted to go to another bar called lucky bar where everyone from Spicy bar was headed to as it was closing.  I was wasted and exhausted and told her she could come home with me then, but I was too tired to go to another bar.  So she started making out with her friend to get me jealous and try and convince me to change my mind.  I was too tired to be baited like that so I told her to have fun and hopped in a Taxi.  My hotel was called BMP but there are two BMP’s in Chiang Mai and I didn’t know which one was mine.  The driver took me to the first one and I didn’t think it was the right one.  Then we went to the second one and it wasn’t the right one either.  At this point I panicked a little bit wondering if there was a third one and I would never find it.  Then I looked at my key and showed it to the driver and he figured out it was the first one we went to that was the right one so he took me there.  I slept until 6 PM the night after and then met the rest of my group for dinner and drinks and then headed to bed early.

  <div class="entry-content"><p>Let me start by saying if you go to Chiang Mai you HAVE to do the 3 day trek.  It was my favorite experience in Thailand so far.</p>

<p>I woke up early to get packed and prepared for our trek which started at 930AM.  Our group consisted of two guides who went by the names Tiger and Tarzan, two Austrian girls, an Australian couple, a Spanish couple who lived in Shanghai, one Army guy from Holland, and myself.  Quite the international crew.  We took a30 minute drive in a van to a local market to pick up supplies like water etc and then headed for the mountains.  We hiked for probably two hours uphill crossing multiple rivers and then had a break for lunch.  Lunch was rice and chicken and some spices and was quite tasty although it didn’t satiate my hunger.  We hiked for about 3 more hours and arrived at one of the Karen villages where we would be spending the night.  The villages are called “hill tribe villages” and they don’t speak Thai or English each village has it’s own language.  Tarzan and Tiger were from these villages and they had lived in Bangkok for a few years to study.  They told us that girls who were not married by 25 were “a very sad story” (one of their favorite expressions and now a group joke) and boy not married by 30 were also a very sad story.  Women who were unmarried were called white dress women because they wore a white dress.  All people from the village were virgins until married which included Tarzan despite the fact that he has two girlfriends in Chiang Mai one of which he lived with for four years.  This seems like quite a lot to handle for very little payoff.  Both of Tarzans parents lived in the village that we stayed in and they cooked dinner for us which was delicious green curry and rice.  They had beers and water in a big cooler and we just wrote down what we drank and were allowed to pay in the morning.  There was a bunch of houses in the village which were built on stilts and we had one big house/cabin for the tour group with small mats and mosquito nets.  The fun of the trip began after dinner as beers were drank, inhibitions were lost, cultural barriers bridged and lots of stories exchanged.</p>

<pre><code>Tarzan told us that in Thailand they have three kinds of Ladyboys.  Beautiful ladyboys were the best looking and the ones who had had the full operation.  Regular ladyboys were beautiful but had not had the operation, and buffalo ladyboys.  None of us had ever heard of buffalo ladyboys so of course we were all very curious.  Tarzan told us in his thick Thai accent, you know Usain Bolt?  In 2012, if you want me to win the Olympics against Usain Bolt, put buffalo ladyboy behind me and he chase me and I run faster than buffalo ladyboy.  So basically buffalo ladyboys are very big manly ladyboys.
In addition the whole evening Tarzan and Tiger were smoking opium along with their mother, so as we got more drunk their stories got even more and more racous although I won’t recant them as they were definitely you had to be there stories.  On the whole though the night was a blast, our group bonded and we all had a great time.  Unfortunately the two Spaniards had to leave at 6AM the next morning, which was quite remarkable to me because Tiger was leading them in the morning and he stayed up all night smoking opium.  They were doing the two day trek so they basically compressed everything we would do over the next two days into one day.  Pretty glad I did not do the 2 day and instead had chosen the three day.  
</code></pre>

<p>The next day we woke up late around 10-11AM and had eggs and toast with jam for breakfast.  We set off on our trek to the waterfall where we’d be staying for the next evening.  This day of hiking was much more fun as we all knew each other better now and had a great time hiking through the jungle together.  We stopped at a village for lunch and Tarzan cooked us some great soup.  I met this little boy who did a little photo shoot with me.  I’m not sure if he’d ever had his picture taken and seen the results but every time I showed him a picture of himself he’d squeal with delight.  He was so much fun.  After lunch we hiked for a few more hours and reached the waterfall by dusk.  The waterfall was beautiful and the water was the perfect temperature for a bunch of sweat soaked travelers and we all quickly donned our bathing suits and jumped in.  It felt amazing to stand under the power of the waterfall and have yourself cleaned off after a long hot day of hiking.  At the waterfall they a bunch of tiny little bungalows that were perfect for one or two people each so the Australians and the Austrian girls shared huts and Pim and I (the kid from Holland) had our own bungalows.  Tarzan made us another excellent dinner of rice and green curry, we lit a bunch of candles on a picnic table and I taught everyone how to play Asshole, Euchre, and Bullshit.  Everyone loved asshole and we had such a blast as the guys ended up president and vice president first which started a lot of shit talking until the girls finally took over power and then per usual the country vs. country shit talking added to the dynamic.  It was a great evening and by the end of the night I felt like I had known the group my whole life.  The highlight of the evening was when Julia (pronounced Yoo-Lia) screamed out FUCK YOUR ASS which she thought was something you’d say in English because we use the word fuck for just about everything.  We all fell on the ground laughing for minutes after hearing this tiny blonde girl scream that at the top of her lungs.<br/>
We had another leisurely morning the following morning getting up around 8AM for eggs and toast.  We walked a few hours to a town where we got picked up in a truck and taken to a small restaurant for spicy noodles and chicken for lunch.  That was followed by a one hour elephant trek into the jungle.  I am in love with elephants.  They are such amazing animals and I still can’t get over how big our elephants were.  The Australians (Rikki and Kieran) had a massive elephant probably between 12-14 feet while the rest of us got elephants that were about 10 feet tall.  Pim and I had a rogue elephant and he pretty much would go wherever he wanted rather than sticking to the path.  At one point he started climbing this hill that must have been climbing a 60 degree incline and I was terrified that he would slip but they are amazingly stable even with two big guys on their backs.  There are a bunch of huts along the ride where they sell bananas to feed to the elephants.  They stick their trunks over their backs and you hold the bananas out and they grab them with their trunks.  It is so cool.  The little Thai guys who would sit on their heads and direct the elephants where to go also would sort of purr at them and the elephants would respond by sort of making a sound like a motor which was really cool.  There were also tank of water along the way and the elephants would drink water and spray it behind them trying to soak you on top of them.  Pretty funny trick.  It’s definitely an experience where you worry that the elephants are abused and have a bad life all for the enjoyment of tourists but this did not seem to be the case.  They only had two riders on them and seemed to be very close with the guys who drove them and weren’t overworked.  Pim told me when he was in Sri Lanka the elephants had to carry 8 people on their back which seemed pretty terrible.  Anyways, I hope the elephants are happy, they seemed to be but I haven’t known that many elephants in my life so I have little basis for saying that.  The elephant ride was capped off with rafting down the river with two bamboo rafts with 3 people on each and a guide steering each raft.  The river was probably 4-6 feet deep so we could jump from raft to raft and knock each other off and swim along with the raft.  It was a beautiful day and it was such a great end to the trip.  Unfortunately our fun was cut short when Rikki got her finger pinched between a rock and a raft and ripped her pinky fingernail off.  This brought our journey to an unpleasant end but her finger is all right now and it was not the end of the world.<br/>
