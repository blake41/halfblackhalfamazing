  <div class="entry-content"><p>So if you are wondering about the lack of posts, it is because my computer got stolen.  It kind of took the wind out of my sails as far as keeping this blog up to date.  I am headed back to NYC in less than an hour and should be home on friday by 8pm.  More for my own diaries sake than anything else I might put up some posts that finish out the journey as I have not posted about mendoza, patagonia, BA, paraty, isla grande or carnaval.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>I finally met up with the French girl I met on the bust to BA, Carmen.  We went to Thelonius jazz bar which was really nice.  It was only 20 peso cover and the bar had a really cool ambiance.  We grabbed some seats on the couch and settled in for a great night of Jazz.  We had a couple glasses of wine and my french started to get much better.  I had a great time hanging out with her and speaking French for the first time in ages.  Things were going really well and we went outside to have a cigarette.  I don&#8217;t know about girls reading this, but I feel like as a guy you hit a point in a date where you&#8217;re like things are going well, im going to kiss this girl, and you just know things are going to work out.  However, right about when I hit this point, this guy comes out, who she had introduced me to earlier, who starts being all touchy feely with her.  At this point I figure this must be her boyfriend and that things are NOT going to work out for me.  We went back inside and the bar emptied out and it was just sort of the friends of staff after hours crew and we opened a bottle of champagne and sat at the bar and hung out.  At this point I could ask her point blank if that was her boyfriend because he didn&#8217;t know french and wouldn&#8217;t know what I was saying.  She told me he was and that he was just being jealous, you know how Argentinian men are.  I told her I thought it was reasonable to be a bit jealous given that she brought another dude to his bar and was being really flirtatious with him.  Oh well, all in all it was a really fun night, despite finding out some bad information a little late in the game.<a href="http://halfblackhalfamazing.files.wordpress.com/2010/01/img_1082.jpg"><img src="http://halfblackhalfamazing.files.wordpress.com/2010/01/img_1082.jpg" alt="" /></a></p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>After La Boca I went to Sugar bar with a couple of the guys I&#8217;d been hanging out with.  Sugar bar has 5 peso anything you want happy hour until midnight.  That&#8217;s about $1.25 USD.  So we chilled there for a couple of hours.  Then we headed over to Bahrein which was having a drum and bass night.  One of the guys we were with was super into drum and bass and the hostel was going to be at the bar so I figured I&#8217;d check it out not knowing what drum and bass is.  For the record, drum and bass is really terrible music, in my opinion.  So after about an hour there, I was like I can&#8217;t take any more of this.  We went outside and tried to find a few other options, but at that time I ran into one of the girls from the hostel, a beautiful indian girl with an english accent, basically my Kryptonite.  She convinced me to stay and hang out with her, which of course I acquiesced to.  I kicked it with her and her friends at the club for the rest of the night and then went home.[gallery orderby=&#8221;title&#8221;]</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>The day after La Bomba I did a walking tour of La Boca with the love of my life Heidy.  It&#8217;s a really cool area despite existing solely for the purpose of entertaining tourists.  There&#8217;s about 4 blocks of La Boca which are safe for tourists, and the rest, &#8220;the real Boca&#8221; is very dangerous.  The touristy area of La Boca is extremely colorful and all the houses are painted multiple colors because when they were painted about a hundred years ago, the poor would steal paint at night from the port ships and just grab any color and put it on their house and then come back the next night and grab a different color and slowly paint their house in this manner.  La Boca is also famous for being the birthplace of the Tango.  The best part of the Tango is that it seems like a really romantic dance and what not.  The type of thing you learn to do with the love of you life, in my case Heidy, but in reality Heidy informed us that this dance was the dance the sailors did with the hookers.  La Boca was a port, and sailors would come ashore, and of course what do sailors want when they get to port?  So this dance evolved as the dance they did before the other stuff went down.  This may be the funniest thing I&#8217;ve learned in BA so far.</p>

<p>Best part of the day:  There are tango dancers, male and female who approach people of the opposite sex and ask you if you want a picture with them, and they give you a coat and what not so you look like a dancer.  Of course this costs money and I didn&#8217;t want to pay someone just to take a picture with me.  But this gorgeous girl approaches me and is like do you want to take a picture with me and i&#8217;m like no, lo siento, gracias.  And she just goes &#8220;why not&#8221;? And I just froze, and couldn&#8217;t come up with a good reason that wouldn&#8217;t sound like I was cheap or offensive so I just go, OK.  And she smiles, we take some pictures, and I was 20 pesos poorer.  However, the pictures were fun, so all in all I was happy.[gallery orderby=&#8221;title&#8221;]</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>Probably the 1 thing you hear when you are in a hostel in Buenos Aires is that you HAVE to hit up La Bomba.  It&#8217;s a drum performance held in an old warehouse every Monday night. La Bomba not only lives up to its insane hype, it dramatically surpasses it.  The venue itself is really cool.  Picture some abandoned warehouse in Williamsburg with a big stage and video screen on the wall.  There&#8217;s probably a thousand people there.  From 7-8 the amateur drummers are on stage warming up the crowd.  It turns out it was the same crew we saw in the street the night before.  Then the real guys come out at 8 and everyone goes nuts.  I was worried when they first started that none of the tourists would get into it and dance.  However a few songs into the performance everyone was swaying and it turned into a full blown mad dance party.  These girls near me started a little circle and were pulling people into the middle and we were all dancing and getting crazy and shirts came off, beers were spilling everywhere.  It&#8217;s just so f*cking awesome.[gallery orderby=&#8221;title&#8221;]  [youtube=http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nfXnyS-kutQ]</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>I went to San Telmo, which is a really cool area of the city, the village of BA if you will.  We went to a great steakhouse (of course) for dinner and walked around the cobblestone streets a bit.  We ran into a street party on the way there.  There were a whole bunch of people playing drums in the streets and everyone was dancing.  We danced for a while and then headed to dinner.[gallery][youtube=http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EnfQKFyEOn0]</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>Met up with my friend Suraj who I met in Brazil.  Went to watch some horse races which were unbelievably boring.  They don&#8217;t sell any alcohol which was quite a surprise given that we&#8217;re in Argentina.  After that we walked around the market a bit and then went to dinner around 10pm at a Middle Eastern Place.  We had some great beef, hummus and some other stuff that I didn&#8217;t recognize but it all was good.  A few bottles of wine with dinner and then we headed to a nearby lounge/bar.  It was two of Suraj&#8217;s friends, Mako a japanese girl, and Jim an America, his brother Viral who&#8217;s finishing up med school, and a couple from NYC.  The bar was decent and we left around 2am to meet up with Suraj&#8217;s Argentinian friends.  They said the bar we were supposed to go to was not fun and to get in the cars with them and come to something else.  We drove for like 30 minutes before finally arriving at some brothels.  We were quite disappointed to find out that this was what the whole big trip was about.  We tried to politely explain that wasn&#8217;t what we were looking for.  We then got cabs and met up with some other Argentinians Suraj knew who invited us to another party.  I was stoked when we got there as it was all locals and they were playing Reggaeton, which is basically a hip hop beat with spanish vocals.  It&#8217;s really fun to dance to and the party was awesome.  I met a girl who lives in Mendoza and who is going to take me hiking there.  We partied until about 8am and then finally caught a cab home.[gallery orderby=&#8221;title&#8221;]</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>Xmas in BA was awesome.  Most people slept until 2pm or so and then came down to the main bar area and just chilled all day.  I made some xmas phone calls, messed around on the computer and took it easy.  There was a big group of Irish who got wasted and put on these Irish folk songs and were all singing and dancing.  It was pretty awesome<a href="http://halfblackhalfamazing.files.wordpress.com/2010/01/img_1032.jpg"><img src="http://halfblackhalfamazing.files.wordpress.com/2010/01/img_1032.jpg" alt="" /></a></p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>Xmas eve is one of the biggest party nights in Buenos Aires.  Our hostel had a big party up until 2am and then had a shuttle that took people to Pasha.  Pasha is a bit pricey so I didn&#8217;t want to roll there.  I ended up going with about 8 people over to a more local stye club around 3 or 4am.  We danced all night at this place and had a blast.  Per usual when we left the club it was fully light out.  <a href="http://halfblackhalfamazing.files.wordpress.com/2010/01/img_1027.jpg"><img src="http://halfblackhalfamazing.files.wordpress.com/2010/01/img_1027.jpg" alt="" /></a></p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>Met some kids at the hostel, British guy, Irish guy, British girl, a German guy, an Aussie couple and we all headed to get dinner at a restaurant called Suca La Vida that was all you can eat for 70 pesos including a bottle of wine and dessert.  Pretty amazing deal.  They have a giant grill with tons of cuts of meats grilling and you just point and whatever you want and they cut you off a slice of it.  They also have a ridiculous salad bar if you&#8217;re into that sort of thing, which I am not.  After dinner I came back and ran into the Canadian guys I had kicked it with the other night and they were drinking screwdrivers in their room with some Aussie girls and listening to music so I partied with them for a bit before doing a 6AM breakfast run to a restaurant across from the hostel.  There were all these old women there (like 50&#8217;s) who were not attractive in the least and we found out that they are prostitutes.  So bizzare.</p>

<p>The next day I did a walking tour of la recolleta which is a wealthy part of the city and has an absolutely amazing cemetary.  Everything in the cemetery is mausoleums, and it&#8217;s where Evita is buried.  I found out that all education in  BA is free including grad school.  This obviously creates problems as you have more students that want to go than you have space, and there&#8217;s really corrupt government involvement in the schools as they take more than half of the taxes that are supposed to go to schools and line their pockets.  The girl who led the tours name was Heidy, half german, half Argentine, and 100% gorgeous.  I&#8217;m in love even though she&#8217;s already taken.[gallery orderby=&#8221;title&#8221;]</p>
