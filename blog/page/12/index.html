  <div class="entry-content"><p>After living in Hawaii for two years I subconsciously developed a pretty well defined idea in my head of what Australia, and all Aussie’s were like.  It wasn’t until I stepped off the plane in Sydney that it even dawned on me that I had all sorts of preconceived notions about what it would be like.  I walked up to the money changer and she was an Indian girl with an English accent.  My mouth dropped and I had to refrain from asking her who she was and what she was doing in Australia.  It’s kind of funny that you can have such a well defined idea about a place totally subconsciously and not even know you think that until you are faced with the fact that it is not what you thought it would be like.  When I got to China I expected it to be all Chinese people, which it was, but it didn’t occur to me that I already had a picture of what it would be like because it WAS what I thought it would be like.  It never occurred to me Australia would look more or less like the US demographically.</p>

<p>Secondly, 24 million people in a country larger than the US.  Please tell me I am not alone on this number being way lower than I had envisioned.  I had mentally assumed something in the realm of 100+ million.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>Anyone who’s a regular reader may have noticed that the blog has gotten a little stale, with few updates since I got to Sydney.  The reason for that is I’m trying only to write about interesting things, and if I got nothing to knock your socks off with, I’m not going to write boring entries.  I know most of you are reading this from work and trying to get out of your cubicle briefly to live vicariously through you, so if my life is not more interesting than yours, I’m not going to bore you with sh*tty entries.</p>

<p>That said, I’m writing this entry from 40,000 feet and will be back in Southeast Asia till I fly to Honolulu on October 28th so expect the blog to be back in full swing.  Also, I think I will have a friend joining me in Northern Thailand after I finish diving on Ko Tao.

  <div class="entry-content"><p>There seems to be a common characterization among foreigners that Americans don&#8217;t travel.  I&#8217;d say this is relatively accurate as in I don&#8217;t think we travel on average as much as many other countries particularly the English.  I&#8217;ve been thinking about why this might be true and whether this is a cultural choice that we don&#8217;t value travel, or whether there might be simple logistical reasons that contribute to the end result much more.</p>

<p>First off let me say that the idea of the Gap Year is phenomenal, and it&#8217;s unclear to me why this is not a standard in America like it is in many other places.  I wish we had it, and I wish I had taken advantage of it.</p>

<p>I believe Americans don&#8217;t travel as much as other countries mostly due to our geographic place in the world.  America, with the exception of maybe the USSR or China has the largest relatively homogeneous geographic area anywhere in the world.  Aussie&#8217;s can hop on a plane and hit so many countries in a concentrated geographic locale (southeast asia).  Europeans can travel all around Europe hitting tons of countries while a similar geographic journey around the states would only get you to 1 country.  We are surrounded by Mexico and Canada so as a landmass we have three countries two of whom are remarkably similar while almost any other similarly sized landmass would have at least 20 or so countries.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>Because I lost my license in Bali I&#8217;ve been carrying around my passport when I go to bars in Australia.  I ran into two Iraqi bouncers on Friday night who commented on my American passports.  &#8220;How do you think George Bush would feel if us two Iraqis killed this American&#8221; they mused aloud.  I gave a nervous laugh and tried to smile.  &#8220;Ahh we&#8217;re just kidding&#8221;, they said, &#8220;Fuck George Bush.&#8221;</p>

<p>So glad to see that almost a year after Obama&#8217;s election while traveling internationaly I can still bask in the warm glow of the 8 years of goodwill America gained in the international community under George Bush.  How long will it take us to right our wrongs in the eyes of the world?  Ever?</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>Thought I would note this since it&#8217;s been such a big help recently.  For anyone traveling internationally, check onetravel.com.  For some reason they seem to have way better deals/flights internationally than kayak which I had been using up until now.  Also, Airasia.com is great for southeast asia travel.  Their travel hubs are bangkok and kuala lumpur and you can pretty much get around anywhere from those spots for 100 or less each way.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>I Found out that one of my good friends from Hawaii, Nana, was back in Sydney.  She invited me to join her for the Katchafire concert on Friday at the Cogee Bay Hotel.  It was a pretty amazing offer considering that Katchafire is probably one of my favorite bands of all time.  They are a Maori band from New Zealand and massively popular in Hawaii and I&#8217;d been dying to see them ever since I first heard them covered live at my favorite bar in the world, Mai Tais in Hawaii.</p>

<p>The concert was definitely one of, if not the best, I&#8217;ve ever been to.  The venue was tiny, maybe a couple hundred people, and the crowd was pumped.  Everyone there were clearly huge fans as we all knew the words and were singing along with the band and skanking our faces off.  The whole scene was just a super fun positive vibe, and the two girls I went with, Nana and her friend Ches were great company.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>I&#8217;m looking into buying one.  Anyone ever done this?  If so which one did you get?  Who did you go through? Was it worth it?  It looks like there are so many options with such different prices and restrictions.  Drop me a line at blake41 at gmail dot com or hit me up in the comments.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>This post is a rant so feel free to skip it.  I just have to get this poison out of my system.</p>

<p>I spent the past two days on the phone with Bank of America, approximately 6 hours and 100 dollars in cell phone credits to get &#8220;emergency cash&#8221; from Bank of America.  I haven&#8217;t ever really been subjected to a customer service experience as frustrating as the ordeal they put me through.  You&#8217;d expect the emergency cash department to be a branch of the bank that catered to your every whim, given that if you&#8217;re calling them, by definition, you&#8217;re out of your home country, most likely without reliable phone service, internet, access to cash, scared, and time sensitive.  I was first put in touch with Visa who they told me could send me an emergency card in 24-48 hours, what a relief!  Only to find out after hours, that since I had a mastercard rather than a visa card, this was not available to me.  Then I got sent to mastercard who doesn&#8217;t do emergency cards that allow you to withdraw cash&#8230;umm seriously?  What the fuck use is a debit card that you can&#8217;t withdraw cash with?  They do do emergency cash up to 1500 USD.  Ok I can live with that for now.  Bank of America told me all they had to do was fax over the paperwork to mastercard, and i could call in a few hours and they&#8217;d tell me where to pick up the money.  Only when I called mastercard they told me what BofA sent them was a denied request for emergency cash?  Why the f<em>ck would they do that?  Back on the phone with BofA.  Oh you denied my request because there was a recent lost card&#8230;not sh</em>t that&#8217;s why I&#8217;m asking for emergency cash! because I don&#8217;t have my f<em>cking card, like why the f</em>ck else would i want emergency cash?  Oh now that I&#8217;m screaming at you you realized that&#8217;s idiotic and you&#8217;ll send me money?  Ok thanks, great, let&#8217;s sort this out.  Oh my phone credit just ran out and I have to start this whole process over again.  Finally I reach Jean, who is the first person in the whole bank who seems to have any idea what I am talking about.  She arranged the money, and told me Mastercard would contact me in 20 minutes to 2 hours.  Unfortunately they didn&#8217;t do that, but not BofA&#8217;s fault on that one.  Called Mastercard in the morning only to be told that they would call BofA to start the request, NO, my request has already been approved, I am just calling to find out where I can pick up my money.  Oh there&#8217;s a new file number with my approved request?  It&#8217;s appended to the old file number?  Do you really think I care?  I just want my money.</p>

<p>Truly a remarkable service.  What if I hadn&#8217;t had friends loan me enough cash to tide me over?  What if I didn&#8217;t have a place to stay with friends where I wasn&#8217;t paying up front?  How can you in good conscience run a system where it takes 6 hours on the phone and 2 days to wire someone emergency cash?  Jean, if you&#8217;re reading this, none of this was targeted at you, you were amazing and so helpful, and saved me from drowning myself in Bondi Beach last night.  Thank you.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>Made a last minute decision to go to Sydney because there wasn&#8217;t really any internet in Indonesia and I need to get some work done.  Meg was leaving Sydney and her roomate was looking for someone to the sublet the day I was leaving Bali so everything worked out perfectly.</p>

<p>It&#8217;s been kind of a whirlwind since I&#8217;ve got here. Slept most of my first day, and then went to an event called the big blind.  It was run by one of Meg and her roomate&#8217;s friends Gina.  It was basically like a group blind date where a bunch of young people some single some not get together and do some kind of fun event.  The event of the evening was salsa dancing and drinks a Thraner&#8217;s bar in Kings Cross.  Surprising a pretty fun evening and a nice way to meet some new people right after arriving in Australia.  I&#8217;ve been thinking about &#8220;dating&#8221; in NYC for a long time and have often thought about running similar things in NY but haven&#8217;t solved all the issues I see with it yet.  Attending this event was inspiring as I think she solved a lot of the issues I&#8217;ve always had with the idea, although there were still problems.  While I was at the event I met a really cool girl who I convinced to take me out and show me Sydney.  She is quite an interesting character.  She&#8217;s only 21 but has more of a sense of self than almost anyone I know of any age.  Oddly enough she&#8217;s the second girl I&#8217;ve been out on a date with that is a beauty pageant winner.  Never thought I would be interested in girls that did beauty pageants, but apparently they are not all as vapid as Miss California. Add Miss India to Miss Colorado.<img src="http://halfblackhalfamazing.files.wordpress.com/2009/09/img_0385.jpg" alt="IMG_0385" /></p>
