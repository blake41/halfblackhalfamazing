  <div class="entry-content"><p>The last night out in Bali was a pretty good time.  We started off the night with some great Sushi and then headed to a bar around the corner that was sort of a divey sort of bar.  One of the great ideas Balinesian clubs/bars have come up with is employing hot girls who are combination bartenders/hostess/just paid to hang out with the partrons.  Even though you know it&#8217;s their job to chat you up, who doesn&#8217;t like conversations with fun friendly people?  It makes the atmosphere of the bar just that much better.  American bars need to follow the lead on this one.</p>

<p>After the dive bar we headed to return our surf boards and ended up with a jam session at Toba&#8217;s surf shop.  Bain and one of the surf shop guys, (I&#8217;m blanking out on his name but I want to say Ro?) played guitars and me and Adam threw down some verses.  Apparently we were both singers in previous lives.  After that we headed towards vi ai pi which was hosting it&#8217;s grand opening and had free drinks.  It was kind of a weak scene so early in the night though so we checked out Joe&#8217;s Place which had Sound Rebel (a local Balinesian Reggae band) playing some great jams.  We sat and watched for about an hour and they played some great tunes.  I drank some Arak, a local rice based liquor, that is banned on Gili due to 26 people having died from drinking it.  My curiosity outweighed my usual distaste for risk and I tried some and really liked it.  After Joe&#8217;s Place we headed over to Sky Garden.  Sky Garden, per usual, was the hot spot and had a pretty good scene going on.  We watched some fire dancers, cruised around the different levels and then settled down on the dance floor.  I met a white girl who ran a surf camp in Bali, lived in Bali, and had just gotten divorced.  Unfortunately about 30 minutes after I met my ideal woman a bunch of Aussies got in a fight right next to me and I caught a beer bottle to the head which opened up a nice gash on my forehead.  I had to leave to go take care of it and so my night ended a little sooner than I would have liked.

  <div class="entry-content"><p>We kept the villa for two nights, and then Leigh left so we figured it was crazy to split the villa three ways so we went back to Kuta.  Every time I walked by this one massage parlor one of the girls would say hi handsome how are you!  So today when everyone left to go back, I decided to go chat her up.  Her name is Katlina and she&#8217;s really cool.  I got a massage and we kicked it for a few hours today.  She wanted to get drinks tonight after she gets out of work but my plane is leaving an hour after she gets out of work and I&#8217;d miss it.<br/>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>We were pretty sick of Kuta, so we looked into a nicer place in Seminyak.  We went to check out some private villas to see what they cost.  When I found out they were 320 per room for two rooms, I was sold.  Unfortunately, about an hour later, we found out that it was not local currency, but USD.  I went to talk to them about our little miscommunication and to see if they’d take 240 USD for the room which would be 60 a person.  They agreed to give it to us for 250, and we decided to keep it as it was one of the most insanely beautiful places we’d ever seen.  The place came with a maid, laundry, private pool, four bedrooms, open air bathroom, just absolutely stunning.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>We got up at 6 AM to watch the sunset from the top of the boat and it did not disappoint.  It was pretty incredible to be on a boat in the middle of the ocean with 4 great friends watching the sunset from the top of a pirate ship.  We arrived at Nusa not much after the sunset, and had another fantastic meal courtesy of Joseph.  We took the dinghy to shore and looked into surfboard rentals.  The waves were on the small side, so I grabbed an 8 foot longboard, which they call a Malibu on Nusa (which I love and am bringing back to the states).  Lonely Planet described Nusa Lembogan as the Bali many expect to find but never do.  I’m not sure I would agree with that assessment.  There weren’t really many beaches, and the island itself was not particularly pretty.  We decided just to stay for the day and take the boat to Bali overnight.  Our crew took us over to a break called shipwrecks, which is a hollow right and the sets were about 6 feet.  We all had a pretty tough day as the wave was pretty steep, we had long boards, and the crowd was not particularly friendly.</p>

<p>I woke up at 7:00 AM despite having gone to bed around 4AM the night before.  The island was even more deserted than usual and I decided to walk West around the island to see how far I could go.  It was a really cool experience to walk around such a beautiful place and be the only person up.  I walked for about 2 hours around the west coast of the island past the developed part of the island to beautiful deserted white sand beaches.  I took some pics of myself meditating and chilling on the beach.  At around 9:30 I got nervous that It’d take forever so I convinced one of the carts that came by in the opposite direction to let me jump in and they gave me a ride back into town.  I met up with the guys for breakfast, we checked out of our hotel, and met up with the English girls back at Rudy’s.  Our boat sailed in from Lombok about an hour later and they picked us up on the dinghy.  Our boat was really cool, with a nice deck, a spacious cabin, a dinner table bolted to the deck, and a second floor built above the stern half of the boat.  We headed to Gili Meno to do some snorkeling.  Almost as soon as we headed out, one of the girls got seasick.  After an hour she decided to go back, so we sent her ashore on the dinghy with one of her friends.  The day was one of the best I’ve ever had.  The weather was beautiful, the snorkeling was fun, and we had a great group of people.  We watched the sunset from the water, while doing all sorts of flips and jumps off the top level of the boat.  After the sunset, Yosef (the only crewmember who spoke English) made us a fantastic dinner, and we drank a few beers on the boat.  We all headed back ashore, the girls back to shower, and us back to Rudys.  The bartenders at Rudys are definitely the best part about the bar.  At the beginning of the night, they all had straws in their ears, and we couldn’t figure out what they were there for.  But as things got fired up they would use them as microphones and sing their favorite songs.  They also would make fun of anyone with a funny accent (like the English and Australians), hilarious dudes.  We met some cool people at the bar, and then our English girls showed up and we chilled out with them playing cards and what not until we had to leave to head to our boat at midnight.  Once we got on board the crew got ready and started the engines to sail overnight to Nusa Lembogan.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>When you go to Bali, everyone who has ever been there tells you to go to the Gili islands, but when pressed, it’s difficult for anyone to really tell you why or what you are going there to see/do.  However, the minute you arrive on the island, it’s immediately clear why you are there.   Where Bali is overrun with tourists, noise, mopeds, taxis, the Gili islands have no motorized transportation.  There is only one road that runs along the beach and horse drawn carriages speed by you with bicycle horns to alert you of their arrival.  The water is a gorgeous clear blue, and you are clearly on island time.  The beach is lined with cool restaurants with little huts and pillows for you to sit on.  There are really only two bars on the island, both on the beach and quite near each other, so when you meet people, there’s no need to get their number to meet up later.  Anyone who goes out on the island goes to the same place, either the Irish Bar, or Rudy’s.  Once we got to the island, some nice folks at a dive shop let us put our bags down in their shop and Adam, Leigh and Justin went to find us a hotel.  Mike and I decided to chill, grab some food and keep an eye on the bags.  While we were bullshitting with the dive shop employees, the idea came up that we could rent one of their ships that were sitting unused in the harbor as a hotel.  It slept 8, and we had 5, and all the food and drinks were included.  He figured he could call the owner and maybe get us a reduced rate off the usual price since we would just be sitting in the harbor rather than using fuel to travel per usual.  We negotiated a 400 USD per night fee and figured we’d check with the other guys to see if they’d like to do it for a night or two.  They were stoked on the idea, and we decided to rent the boat for 48 hours for 1100 USD and sail it to Nusa Lembongan which we were headed to anyways.  We figured since it included all food and drinks and accommodations it would really only cost 70-80 dollars a person more total and we’d have a 100 foot pirate ship to sail around for the next 2 days.  This was by far the best decision we made on the trip so far.  We rented a hotel for the evening and made plans to start our 48 hours at 1pm the next day.  Mike and I headed to the beach to chill and see if we couldn’t meet some people who would want to join us on the boat.  We met back up with the rest of the crew and headed out for dinner.  There’s a great spot right on the beach with these cool glowing orbs on wooden stumps.  The food was pretty good but the ambience was incredible.  After dinner we went to get drinks at Rudy’s bar.  We had heard that Gili might be pretty tame during Ramadan, but the bar scene was still pretty hoppin.  I can’t really imagine what Gili must be like when it goes off, but it must be awesome.  We met a group of 4 English girls who were chillin at one of the little huts on the beach and we played Kings with them or Ring of Fire as they call it.  We had a great time playing with them and invited them on a little tour of the Gilis the next day.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>We got screwed by the people who sold us our ferry ticket who claimed we would be in Gili by night time.  As soon as we got to Lombok our driver informed us it would be another 800 Rupiah to get to Gili that night so we decided to get a hotel and take the cheap ferry we had already paid for in the morning.  Lombok is pretty crazy in that it’s a Muslim island, and there are mosques absolutely everywhere.  It was Ramadan, so all of them were packed with prayer services going on at all hours of the night and morning.  It boggles my  mind that two islands could be so close, and yet have totally different religions, cultures, languages etc.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>Whatever you think about Barack Obama’s term so far domestically, my experience internationally has convinced me that he was the right choice for president.  The reaction you get when you tell people you are American now is met with excitement rather than disgust.  People still will tell you how much they hate George Bush but how happy they are that we elected Obama and what hope they have for our world.  This is true of every country and ethnicity I have run in to.  Particularly the Balinese people love Obama and every time I tell someone I am from NYC they say you are like Obama! Because of course we are both mixed race.  Even in Ubud, which is a very small rural town the people knew Obama and could barely contain their enthusiasm for Obama’s visit to Bali in less than a month.  Our rafting guide even pointed out the hotel along the river where Barack will be staying.  It fills me with pride again to be an American, and I hope I am doing a good job while I travel of being 1/10th the ambassador of this great country internationally that he is.</p>

<p>There are two things I have been struck by in Bali that have been reinforced by a number of conversations I have had with the locals.  The first is how happy and friendly the people are the second is how poor they are.  Every person I have met here wants to chat you up, learn your name, where you are from, what it is like.  Other than Bermuda, I can’t remember being in a friendlier place.  It is also extremely refreshing to see that people can still be happy, and say they love Bali, when they are so poor.  Living in America, and NYC, it is hard to keep sight of the fact that money is NOT everything, and that there is more to being happy than possessing a lot of it.  My time in Hawaii, and in Bali have reinforced that the ability to be happy is more of a choice than it is circumstances.  However, I can’t ignore the fact that both cultures are island cultures and have amazing weather and access to the beach 365 days a year.  Maybe the key to happiness is as simple as that.</p>

<p>Two conversations with locals have stuck with me.  The first was with my massage therapist when we were talking about my work, and her work, and I asked her how long she went to school for.  She has never been to school, and apparently only wealthy kids in Bali go to school as there is no free public school.  First I was impressed that with no access to formal education she had a pretty good mastery of the English language and spoke 3 languages to my 1 and a half.  It’s pretty amazing how much we take for granted in our access to free education, even with all the problems the American education system has.  The thought that one could be born into a situation and have no access to any system to better ones self through learning is mind blowing.  It certainly gives you perspective when I think of all the time and energy I spent growing up avoiding school, school work, and my education in general.  What a blessing I had that I did not appreciate.</p>

<p>The second conversation I had was with my waitress in Uluwatu after a day of surf.  We talked for about an hour about her life and my life.  She was telling me how she would love to travel and “go on holiday” like we do, but Balinese people do not have money for travel.  I think this might be one of the reasons that the local people are so curious to talk to you and learn more about where you come from.  They have no access to education, or information outside of their small island, and all are highly intelligent and curious people who take advantage of every opportunity to better themselves.  The recent advent of the tourism industry and Bali has brought tremendous opportunity for growth and learning about the world which the Balinese have taken full advantage of.     It’s hard to imagine a life without travel, especially one in which you are constantly surrounded and serving people more fortunate than you as they get to experience the magic of travel and the culture and wonder that is Bali.  To still be happy every day and live your life to the fullest given this obvious disparity is remarkable to me and inspiring.  The Balinese people have many traits which I aspire to emulate as I grow older.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>We got up at 2:30 AM to catch a taxi to a volcano to start our journey along the east coast.  We met up with our guides around 4AM at the base of the volcano and climbed about 2 hours up the volcano in the pitch black to catch the 6:20AM sunrise.  The sunrise/view was the most spectacular I can ever remember seeing.  You have 360 degree views of all of Bali and the sun rises just to the North of Angung mountain and is spectacular.  It’s also one of the few mountain sunrises I’ve seen where the clouds don’t block the views.  After we reached the summit they cooked us breakfast including eggs cooked using the volcano’s steam for heat.  Our guide, Made (which means second child in Bali) took us down the back of the ridge to see where the lava comes out of the crater and to the naturally heated hot   springs.  We checked out the hot springs but they weren’t that cool and not nearly as awesome as the hot springs I’d been to in Costa Rica so we passed and headed East.  We had a pretty interesting taxi ride as Mike and I chatted up our driver with regards to all the changes since tourism has hit Bali.  He said that since 1990 there has been tons of changes most notably that sex before marriage is much more acceptable than it used to be.  Our conversation started with a lesson on Hinduism and their versions of heaven and hell.  He said that if woman is promiscuous and has sex with lots of men she is not married to, in her next life she will be reincarnated and all her desires would be fulfilled by gigolo pig.  Gigolo pig is the name for a male pig who is kept just to impregnate female pigs.  If a male is promiscuous before marriage his penis will be burned off by a hot poker.  I was interested to note that female and male promiscuity is punished equally harshly and there isn’t the double standard that there is in the West.  He said in practice though, promiscuity outside of marriage has grown tremendously since the 1990’s as tourism, movies and western culture have influenced the culture in Bali.  Before 1990 women were not really allowed to be on the streets after 6pm, but now many work in hotels and get out later which began the change in dynamic.  He also believed that young children would see sexuality in movies, which caused them to want to satisfy their desires, that weren’t there before the internet and movies.  Now he says 50% of teenagers have had sex, whereas maybe 0 or 1 in 10 would have had before.  I had been told by someone in Hong Kong who had just returned from Bali that almost all women out at bars were prostitutes but our driver informed me that there are prostitutes but many women he called “naughty girls” who are just interested in trying different “styles” and that you don’t pay but they like Westerners and will sleep with them when they meet them at bars.  However, Balinese girls/women do not like to be kissed in public as this is highly frowned upon.  We finally finished our journey at Padangbai where were had planned to stay the night, but decided since we made it so early to just hop the ferry a day early and head to the Gili Islands.  We are headed to Gili Trawangan where there are no cars and many people have told me it was their favorite part of Bali.  It is a Muslim island and they are currently celebrating Ramadan so we are hoping it will still be a good trip.   I think we might splurge tonight since there is 5 of us and we have heard about some obscenely beautiful villas you can rent.  Our driver said if we go out it will be very easy for us to meet some “Naughty Girls” so we will see what happens.  On the ferry to Lombok right now should be in Gili by 9PM tonight.  Can’t wait.</p>
