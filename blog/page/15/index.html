  <div class="entry-content"><p>Finally got back to Hong Kong after an exhausting flight and train ride.  I can’t remember the last time I was so happy to get somewhere, but returning to Hong Kong feels like returning home after being in China.  We got a room at the Hotel Jen which was awesome, half the price of our other hotel (like 50 USD) centrally located, and so much nicer.  I recommend anyone who visits HK to stay there.  It has an open air rooftop pool, awesome 28th floor bar overlooking the city, and a great buffet breakfast.  We were supposed to meet up with Angad but we waited till about 11:30 PM and he still was at work ( I don’t understand why these finance people do it).  We went to Wung Fan, a great dumpling place on wellington street recommended by Matt.  Headed back to our hotel and drank a bottle of Rum which was terrible.  We took a cab to tonic because it was the only bar we knew of, and then walked around the different bars in central basically following any cute girls we saw.  Hong Kong doesn’t seem like the type of place where you pick a bar and go to it for the night, everyone seems to move in and out of each bar every 10 minutes which is probably due to everything having an open front rather than a door.  The night was pretty fun, went to drop and gecko and a couple other random spots I don’t remember.  We met a bunch of groups of cute girls but nothing really came out of it.  I met the only two black guys I saw in my entire time in HK and they were real chill.  They had just come back from Bali from a wedding of one of the guys tenants.  He must be an awesome landlord to get invited to a tenants wedding.  He said indo girls do not drink or go out, only indo girls out are pro’s.  Grabbed some late night philly cheese steaks and tried to convince some girls we met there to come back to our hotel and jump in the pool (which we knew was closed) with us to no avail.  Then headed back to the hotel.  Packed up our stuff and headed out to the airport as we had a 9am flight.  3rd time pulling an all nighter on the trip so far.  The Hong Kong nightlife is awesome, and probably would be more awesome if you lived there, or spent more time getting into the scene.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>The first thing you are struck by in China is the lack of any sort of rules of the road.  Thousands of people on mopeds, few traffic lights, and passing whenever you want.  Ironically China is supposed to be repressive compared to America but the actual day to day lives of most people here seem to be bound by significantly less rules and structure than it is in America.  I wonder if Chinese immigrants feel that America has a significantly more controlling government than China?</p>

<p>When I went to write some blog posts from China I couldn’t figure out why the internet wasn’t working when I tried to connect to my blog site.  It finally dawned on me that there is no free speech in China and that facebook, tumblr, and wordpress were all blocked.  The concept of the internet being restricted had, until then been a relatively surreal concept that I knew existed but didn’t seem real.  It was pretty wild to experience this lack of access firsthand.</p>

<p>Changing money in China is absurd.  You can only change money at the Bank of China, not to be confused with the Agricultural Bank of China or the Commercial Bank of China nor the Industrial Bank of China.</p>

<p>Taxi drivers hate using their meters and literally will laugh at you if you ask or suggest that they turn it on and will not take you.</p>

<p>The culture of haggling over almost all prices gets to be quite tiresome.  Always wondering if you are getting a fair or good price becomes stressful.  It also often seems silly when you realize that you are haggling over a dollar or two that you wouldn’t think twice about spending in NYC.  I wonder if your average street vendor or person selling service in China to residents or tourists would be better served to just post a higher price and have everyone pay a high fixed posted price rather than trying to screw a couple people and have the majority of people bargaining the price down.</p>

<p>It was interesting to talk to fellow travelers about their experience in travelling in China.  Everyone I talked to felt that China was a very difficult place to travel and very unwelcoming to foreigners.  My initial reaction when I got to China was such but I tried to overlook this so as not to be the arrogant American who expects everyone to know English.  However, it seemed like no matter what country people were travelling from, they all knew English, and expected the Chinese would as well.</p>

<p>People didn’t seem to know street addresses in Guilin.  It’s still unclear to me how this is possible.</p>

<p>After our experiences in Hong Kong, Guilin, Shenzen, and Yangshuo, I’d love to see what a big international city like Beijing or Shanghai is like.  Are they more similar to Hong Kong or Shenzen?</p>

<p>Living in NYC and having gone to Dartmouth makes you feel very wise, cosmopolitan and worldly, yet being in china for a week has never made me feel more ignorant.  Until a week ago I did not know Hong Kong and Macau were not part of China.  I didn’t know that Hong  Kong was a British Colony until their 100 year lease expired in 1997.  I didn’t realize how big cities were in China.  I expected Shenzen and Guilin to be rural china, but they are massive very modern cities significantly larger than Boston.   I don’t know a thing about how China’s communist gov’t really works, or how they actively manage the economy.  Shenzen has 8 million people! Have any of you ever heard of it?</p>

<p>As China continues to grow and develop, they have the opportunity to create their country however they want, using the lessons of the great civilizations and cities that have evolved since the industrial revolution.  Will they surpass all other great cities by learning from the mistakes of others and building infrastructure from scratch rather than trying to evolve broken systems already in place?</p>

<p>Everyone in China seems to be a hustler.  Wherever you go people are moving, selling, working.  I wonder if this is a cultural phenomenon or the inevitable product of 1.3 billion people competing for scarce resources?</p>

<p>The ability these days to travel with a netbook and almost no planning is remarkable.  Everyone should get one of these for travel as well as a kindle.  I can’t get over how awesome both have been.  Every place we go has wireless and we sit down, grab a beer and make a plan for the next day, looking up hotel reviews, things to see, places to eat, and within 30 minutes have synthesized the collective knowledge of millions of travelers into a place to stay and a plan to optimize our stay in each place.  Netbooks give you the ability to deviate from a plan in seconds.  I love being able to stay in touch with people via gchat and this blog rather than the phone.  The experience of travelling will be better because of this shift.</p>

<p>One of the more interesting things I’ve noticed about travelling in India and China is the relationship of males and females in the society.  The vast majority of hospitality staff (stewardess, front desk at hotels) are female, pretty, young, and extremely friendly.  Their truly is a sense that they are there to serve you and happy to make your experience better.  This seems to stem from the historical male/female power dynamic where a woman’s job is to serve her husband.  As the son of a progressive feminist mother it is strange to travel in a place and observe this phenomenon firsthand.  I can’t say that I agree with a cultural dynamic where a woman’s job is to serve me, but I&#8217;d be lying if I said it isn’t a wonderful feeling.</p>

<p>After a short 1 hour plane ride from Shenzen we arrived in Guilin.  The taxi ride to our hotel from the aiport took about 30 minutes and had pretty amazing scenery.  Guilin is what you think of when you picture China.  Beautiful lush greenery and rolling hills and mountains.  No one speaks English here and it is very local.  We slept all day and went out to dinner at a Chinese restaurant.  We got chicken, beef and dumplings along with some rice.  The chicken was not like Chicken you get at an American Chinese restaurant.  They give you the WHOLE CHICKEN.  Head, eyes, feet, wings, heart.  Most of you reading this probably know what a picky eater I am but I tried to be adventurous and eat some of it until Leigh pointed out the heart and then I felt like I was going to be sick.  I know that probably makes me a stupid American tourist but I couldn’t pretend to like it.  The beef was ok and the dumplings were good.  Headed back to the hotel and will probably walk around the city later tonight.</p>

<p>Whenever Porter would email me from China he would end with, “You have to come see the circus that is China.”  I always assumed this was Porter being Porter, but he was for real.  The dichotomy between Hong Kong and China is quite stark and remarkable.  Hong Kong was a truly international city where everyone spoke English and was incredibly nice and helpful.  The minute you cross the border into China no one speaks English and can’t be bothered to help you find anything.  We also were tricked by a man dressed like a policeman who derailed us from finding our train in order to sell us a bus ticket or a restaurant or something that was unclear.  By the time we figured out where to buy our tickets for the train they were sold out.  We had been travelling for about 2 hours at this point and were pretty frazzled and Leigh and I nearly freaked out.  I learned a lesson a long time ago when I lost my backpack in Cancun and spent the day trying to find it missing out on a great booze cruise instead of just accepting the loss and moving on.  So we decided to go to the Shangri-La Shenzen hotel (a 5 star hotel) and grab a quick drink to chill out, get wireless and make a plan.  The options were either to rush to the airport and try and get a plane to Guilin, or stay in Shenzen for the night and catch a 9am flight to Guilin.  We decided to get a hotel (a pretty surprisingly baller room at the Best Western) and catch the early flight.  This was by far the best decision of the trip so far.  I was exhausted so I took a nap while Leigh walked around a little bit.  Around 11 he returned to the room with two 22 ounce beers purchased for 9 Yuan (around  1.50 USD) and told me the city looked crazy and we HAD to go out.  I jumped in the shower, we downed the beers and asked the concierge where the hot spot was.  We hopped in a cab over to Soho Bar.  We were told that the club was full but if we bought a table for 600 Yuan we could go in.  The table did not come with a bottle so we went next door to Milk Bar.  At Milk Bar it is bottle service only meaning everyone has a table and everyone has to buy a bottle.  A bottle was 600 Yuan and we got Chivas Regal.  The bar is set up with long skinny tables that you stand at with a group at each spot (usually like a few guys and girls per bottle) along the table.  Each group gets their own bartender and whatever mixers they want to go with their bottle.  The hostess was really cool and explained to us how everything worked and I immediately fell in love with her.  The craziest thing about Milk Bar was that all the music was American Rap music, think Biggie, 2 Pac, Kanye etc.  So everyone is dancing and what not to the music but not one person in the club spoke English so no one had any idea what the music was saying.  Leigh and I just took it all in for a few hours and then Milk Bar started to really pick up.  The girls in the bar were all pretty unbelievable smokeshows.  Once we got a little liquid courage under our belts I used one of my standard break the ice moves and asked a cute girl in a white dress to take a picture of me and Leigh.  Leigh then started flirting with her which was pretty impressive given that she didn’t speak English and he doesn’t speak Chinese.  I guess the language of love is universal.  Leigh fell in love immediately.  She then introduced us to the club owner, Jerry, who was the man.  He brought us another bottle of Cheval on him and told us whatever we wanted was on him for the rest of the night.  He then introduced us to his sister and her friend and told them to take care of us and introduce us to some girls.  Jerry spoke really good English and was about 25-30 and clearly the man in Shenzen.  Jerry got us a bottle of champagne which comes in a bucket of ice with fireworks shooting out of it.  It was awesome.  By this point Leigh and I were pretty far gone and we were unabashedly hitting on every girl in the bar, literally dominating the scene.  They had girls who came around with suitcases filled with cigarettes and cigars which we smoked as if we were ballers in some movie.  Jerry introduced us to the DJ who was an incredible DJ as well as his brother and pretty much pimped us out all night.  I fell in love with some girl in a blue dress but have no memory of any of this.  Leigh says we were both spitting hot fire but I have no recollection and neither of us left with a girl.  He says that the girls were very traditional and it was not the sort of scene where you could get a girl to go home with you.  I like this explanation much better than maybe my Chinese game is not as honed as I think it is.  We headed back to the hotel and went to the Spa which is open 24 hours.  We got massages from two cute Chinese girls.  We got a 2 hour massage and I spent about two hours trying to convince my girl to go back to my room with me but she kept motioning to the window in the door I think trying to convey that her boss was watching.  She did give me a kiss which I consider a victory.  She also called a prostitute to come take care of me because she could not.  After our two hour massage we got foot massages.  About 30 minutes into the foot massage the prostitute my massage therapist called showed up in a tight silver dress and was obscenely hot.  She also had a hotel badge on meaning she worked for the hotel which I think is hilarious, and Leigh was terrified.  I explained the miscommunication that I was only interested in my massage therapist and did not want to pay for sex and she left.  At about 630AM we finally called it a night.  I gave a 200 Yuan tip to my massage therapist on a 350 Yuan massage and a 100 Yuan tip to the guy who brought me my clothes.  Then we went back to our room, packed up our stuff and got in a cab to the airport.  Definitely top 3 craziest/best/most fun nights of my life.</p>

<p>Update: Leigh says I tried to convince our massage therapists to come with us to Guilin and offered to buy them a hotel room and plane tickets.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>Our second night in Hong Kong we took the Star Ferry to Kowloon Island.  The ferry gives you an incredible view of the Hong  Kong skyline which I would like to reiterate has got to be the best in the world.  We checked out the Peninsula hotel which is a 5 star hotel with a bar on the 28th floor which overlooks the water and has a great view of Hong Kong Island.  We retired pretty early in hopes of getting an early start on Tuesday and hitting up Lantau Island before heading to Shenzen.  We got a bit of a late start on Tuesday as we were trying to find a surf shop we had spotted a few days earlier and ended up chatting with the cashier there for about an hour.  He told us we didn’t have time to go to Lantau but should check out Sham Shui Po.  We caught the MTR over there and found that Sham Shui Po was exactly what I had pictured Hong Kong to be like;  Street vendors everywhere selling just about anything for almost nothing.  Leigh bought some shoes, I got a backpack and some other trinkets and then we caught the MTR back to check out of our hotel and get the train to Shenzen.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>After the hike we took a cab back to our hotel and slept for a few hours to prepare for the evening ahead.  Matt and Ann invited us to join them in Macau (China’s Vegas) an island about an hour from Hong Kong by ferry.  They were staying at a friends Penthouse who was away for the weekend.  We got into Macau around 9, and got a pretty nice Penthouse room at the Sun Sun Hotel for about a hundred bucks.  Leigh bought a bottle of Johnnie Walker Red Label which we downed before meeting Matt and Ann and another couple at the Wynn for drinks.  The hotels in Macau were pretty incredible and in my opinion Macau absolutely dominates Vegas.  Just the fact that it’s an island vs. a desert would put it over Vegas, but the old Portuguese architecture of the city is awesome as well.  I’m not much of a gambler, but I decided that on this trip I wanted to try and have fun doing whatever the locals do wherever I am, so I figured I would pretend to like gambling for the evening.  We sat at a 100 HKD minimum blackjack table and immediately developed a great repor with our fellow tablemate and dealer.  Our tablemate’s name was Li and she was a 50 year old asian woman.  Our dealer was Connie who absolutely loved us and thought we were ridiculous.  For some reason no one in the entire casino was drinking which made us assume that there was no free drinks for gamblers like there is in Vegas.  We were quickly assured by Connie that we could have all the free drinks we wanted so we ordered some gin and tonics and a bunch of whiskey shots.  Leigh and I took out 2000 HKD (like 275 USD) and I proceeded to burn through it pretty quickly.  I burned through another 2000 HKD in about another hour and was completely wasted at that point.  I decided to cut myself off until Leigh convinced me to keep playing by giving me a 100 chip so I could play one last hand.  Luckily Leigh’s 1 chip loan allowed me to continue playing for another 4 hours.  We had an incredibly fun evening gambling and I think I may have to add gambling to my list of vices.  Li was an incredible team leader as she had the hot hand.  She probably pulled 11 or so blackjacks in the 6 hours we played (Midnight – 6AM).  I would say Li how are you feeling and she would do thumbs up if I was supposed to be big, or thumbs down if I had bad luck.  I would also ask Connie if she was feeling weak or strong and she would tell me how many 100 chips to bet.  Using their advice as betting indicators I went on a 10,000 HKD run and ended the night up 6,000 HKD (approx 750 USD).  We taught Li and Connie BAP and Bapped it out all night.  It’s hard to do the scene justice in words.  At 6am we finally decided to hit some clubs, but we didn’t realize how late it had gotten.  I think we tried to go to the Grand Lisboa’s club but were told it had been closed for hours.  At that point Leigh and I went and got late night fried rice and then called it a night.</p>

<p>The next day we tried to do a little tourist sightseeing in Macau but basically it was a bust.  We were exhausted and hungover and the sights in Macau were pretty weak.  I was going to bungee jump off the Macau Tower (which is very similar to the Space Needle in Seattle) but it was 1500 HKD which seemed pretty pricey to me. We caught the ferry back to Hong Kong and took a much needed nap.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>Matt took us on an epic hike on Monday called the Maclehose trail.  We did the second of a 10 part trail.  It was 12K and one of the most beautiful hikes I’ve ever been on.  The terrain was really hilly and you are basically walking through the mountains down to beaches and then back up through the mountains.  We stopped at Big Wave Beach which was oddly named given that there wasn’t even a hint of any waves.  They were renting surfboards at the beach which was quite the tease because Leigh and I had been hoping the whole hike that we’d discover some waves and be able to mess around with some long boards but alas it was not to be.  It must have been about 90 degrees and we all were completely soaked with sweat about an hour into the hike.  The water at big wave bay was really warm and felt incredible after a few hours of hiking.  After a brief stop to play in the water we continued on and hiked the rest of the trail.  The end of the trail overlooks some gorgeous blue rivers and then takes you back to a main road.  After this hike I was pretty amazed that Matt had run this entire trail (all 100KM) in a competition as we were totally spent after just one section of it.

  <div class="entry-content"><p>Somehow I forgot to mention that we went to a restaurant called Habibi our first night in Hong Kong.  Matt said they had good food and there was a sign outside that said they had a free belly dancing show that started in 10 minutes.  The restaurant was middle eastern food (Egyptian?) and the show was really cool.  I got some sort of blue Martini which was terrible.  Oh well, you win some you lose some<img src="http://halfblackhalfamazing.files.wordpress.com/2009/08/mg_1861.jpg" alt="Belly Dancer" /></p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>Got into Hong Kong at around 1PM on Saturday after being on planes since 5PM Thursday.  Long journey but the legs on Malaysia Air from Mumbai to Kuala Lumpur and then on to Hong Kong were awesome.  Watched the new Star Trek movie and almost finished High Fidelity which is phenomenal so far.  Hong Kong Airport is super modern and makes JFK look archaic.  They have free wi-fi (how do all airports not provide this in 2009?).  The airport express train cost about 10 bucks to take us to Hong Kong in about 27 minutes.  China has the whole high speed rail thing figured out.  How we don&#8217;t have comparable transportation in the US amazes me.  Booked a hotel in &#8220;Central&#8221; called the Central Park Hotel.  Had a little bit of confusion with the front desk and they thought we wanted one double bed instead of two single beds.  Luckily we figured things out and were about to get single beds although I think they are sized for Chinese people as my feet hang off the edge.  The room we are staying in has got to be a practical joke.  It can&#8217;t be more than 12 feet wide and 15 feet long.  There is a shower with all glass that is probably 5 feet from Leigh&#8217;s bed and a toilet right next to it.  There is no door that separates the bathroom area from the room it is all just one room.  Suffice it to say that this is the closest I will ever get to being in a gay marriage.   We met up with Matt and Ann at the Peak Tram.  It was about 100 degrees in the line  and Matt soaked through his shirt while we waited about an hour in the line.  The wait was well worth it.  The cable car ride to the top of the peak overlooking Hong Kong was incredible, and the view from the top was one of the most stunning views I&#8217;ve ever experienced.  The Hong Kong skyline dwarfs New York&#8217;s by such a large margin it&#8217;s silly.  Each building is unique and they put on coordinated light shows on the buildings at 8PM every night.  We took some pictures and then headed back to the city to get drinks.  After a stop at the Globe bar (which was a Rugby bar straight out of London) we headed home to get some much needed sleep.  Great introduction to this phenomenal city.<img src="http://halfblackhalfamazing.files.wordpress.com/2009/08/mg_1816.jpg" alt="Hong Kong Skyline" /></p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>I&#8217;m trying to hit at least 5 and most likely less than 10 countries in two continents over the next 4-6 months.  The trip was supposed to start in India but due to delays with work I had to skip it.  I still had to fly into Delhi, down to Mumbai, and take a cab from the domestic to international terminals in Mumbai.  For some reason the terminals are not connected and it takes about 30 minutes to travel 10km to the international terminal.  Just that 30 minute ride through Mumbai was a pretty eye opening experience.  I was struck first by the massive amount of people everywhere.  The level of poverty was also at a level I had never experienced.  People walk across the highways in bare feet.  A family surrounded my car and was knocking on the windows begging for food.</p>

<p>My short time in India really drove home the point that we are incredibly lucky to have been born where we are.  When KG screamed &#8220;anything is possible&#8221; he should&#8217;ve qualified it with &#8220;as long as you grew up in a country with social mobility&#8221;.  The whole concept of a caste system is antithetical to how Americans perceive the world.  While I often see people unhappy in their work in NY, they at least get to choose their miserable lives.  It is not what we choose, but the choice itself that we should be thankful for.<img src="http://halfblackhalfamazing.files.wordpress.com/2009/08/img_0009.jpg" alt="Taxi Ride in Mumbai" /></p>
