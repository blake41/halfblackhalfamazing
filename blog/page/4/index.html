  <div class="entry-content"><p>The overnight bus to Buenos Aires was cool, the longest ride I&#8217;d been on, and it kind of felt like all the people on the bus were on an adventure together.  I met a French girl who was studying architecture in BA for the past few months.  We chatted quite a bit during the ride and I got to practice my french which was surprisingly passable.  I got her email address and she invited me to join her at a jazz club called Thelonius in BA later that week.</p>

<p>The minute I arrived in BA I knew I was going to love it.  The city feels alive and is really vibrant and beautiful.  Most of the buildings were built in the early 20th century when Argentina had a GDP equivalent to the United States so the architecture is all European, mostly French, and absolutely gorgeous.  The two main buildings are the &#8220;Pink House&#8221; where the President works, and La Congresso where the Congress works.  I&#8217;m staying at the Milhouse hostel on Avenida de Mayo, which is kind of amazing to me given that I imagine the price of a building on this beautiful main street must be quite large.  The hostel itself is pretty amazing.  Its 6 floors, and about 5 rooms per floor which at 8 people per room makes it about 250 people.  They also have another one down the road which is smaller.  It&#8217;s quite the operation.  Inside there&#8217;s a nice reception area and a huge bar/billiards/lounge area.  The bed is cheap here but the beers are kind of crazy expensive at 10 pesos per beer but since you aren&#8217;t allowed to bring in outside alcohol you have little choice but to patronize the hostel bar.</p>

<p>One of my first orders of business was to get drinks with Tim Katz, since he was down here with a Stanford Business School trip.  After meeting all the business school kids I can&#8217;t say I&#8217;m dying to go to business school.  Apparently there&#8217;s an expression &#8220;third chancers&#8221; which refers to kids who weren&#8217;t cool in high school, weren&#8217;t cool in college, and now are trying their hardest to be cool at business school, which is their third and last chance.  I was hoping since it was their last night that everyone would be dying to go out and dance all night but that was not the case.  We went to a chic bar, had some drinks and then moved to an irish pub before retiring around 2am.  I had a great time seeing Katz again, hearing about his trip to SEA and just generally catching up.  I also brought along a chill Canadian guy  I met in the hostel bar. [gallery orderby=&#8221;title&#8221;]</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>I&#8217;m probably going to do a bad job of this due to the fact that things fade over time in terms of my excitement over them, but here&#8217;s my best shot at ranking the places i&#8217;ve been.</p>

<ol>
<li>Laos - Amazingly beautiful.  Luang Prabang is super chill.  Boat ride down Mekong river may be my favorite 2 days of the whole trip.</li>
<li>Argentina - Buenos Aires is gorgeous, french architecture, really cheap, friendly people, great clubs, beautiful women, amazing vineyards, hiking, rafting, hang gliding, patagonia.</li>
<li>Brazil - Rio, Floripa, enough said.</li>
<li>Japan - The most different developed country you can go to.  Beautiful scenery, friendly people, great food, Tokyo rules.</li>
<li>Hong Kong - New York in Asia.  Spectacular view from the tram to the top of the city, beautiful beaches and hikes 20 minutes outside of the city.</li>
<li>China - Just so different.  Yangshuo may be the most beautiful place I&#8217;ve ever been.  Also just so crazy and hectic.</li>
<li>Thailand - Amazing beaches and islands in the south.  Northern Thailand is super chill.  Elephant rides, zip lines, trekking.</li>
<li>Bali - Killer Surf, best waves I&#8217;ve ever surfed.  Super cheap, great people.  Too many Aussies.</li>
<li>Sydney - Amazing to have a proper city and amazing beaches right there.  Just too high a cost:awesomeness ratio.</li>
<li>Hawaii - Hawaii rules but i&#8217;ve been before so just not that exciting.
11.Kuala Lumpur - It just sucked.</li>
</ol>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>After Curitiba I headed to Iguacu Falls.  Most people go to the falls for a couple of days, but knowing myself, I planned on only a few hours.  I love natural beauty, but I just don&#8217;t know how long you can stare at a waterfall for.  I caught an overnight bus from Curitiba to Iguacu which was a pretty terrible bus ride.  The woman next to me had to be at least 250 pounds, and rather than sleeping on her back in the seat like a normal person, she slept in the spoon position facing me.  This meant that her head was resting on my shoulder, and she was breathing on my face.  At different points during the trip, her hand would be resting on my leg.  I didn&#8217;t know how to politely ask her, in Portuguese, to get off of me so I just suffered in silence.  Anyways, I rolled into the bus station around sunrise and headed to the falls by local bus.  The Brazil side of the falls are quite developed, there&#8217;s a whole national park, and a bus that takes you to various points in the national park if you want to do hiking, or white water rafting or other outdoorsy stuff like that.  I just hopped off at the falls and did the hour long walk along the falls.  They really are quite spectacular.  There&#8217;s so many of them and there&#8217;s some metal walkways that have been built that take you almost into some of them.  I spent a few hours checking out the waterfalls and then headed back to the bus station to catch another overnight bus to Buenos Aires.[gallery]</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>Let me start by saying this was the most insane night of my life.</p>

<p>Liza Rosenbaum has family down in BA, so she invited me to come to an asado (bbq) at her place.  I went over there at like 9, and ate lots of meat.  It was a really fun time, beautiful house, great food, and great company.  They had tons of drinks so we were all drinking together and lighting fireworks and then had a little dance party.  I had to be back to my hostel by like 130AM.  I went outside to find one, but I couldn&#8217;t get a taxi back to my hostel.  I needed to get back because there was a 2am shuttle to Pasha this club everyone was going to that i&#8217;d alread bought tix for.  And i made out with this gorgeous indian chick the other night from the hostel who i wanted to hook up with on nye at pasha.  So Liza&#8217;s bro said they&#8217;d just give me a ride to Pasha when they headed to their party.  But in the meantime i started making out with her Argentinian cousin.  So I was like fuck pasha i&#8217;ll just roll with you guys.  We drove like 2 hours at like 3 or 4 am to a rave outside the city in this huge park.  Everyone was on acid.  I had a great time dancing and fucking around with Liza&#8217;s cousin, then she had to go home (she lives with her parents which was devastating) then at like 11am we headed home, but the dude who was driving was tripping balls and I was like I&#8217;m not getting in a car with this dude, but Liza was like you don&#8217;t really have any other options, and she was right.  So we drove about an hour home before this guy turned onto the wrong highway, as in we were driving on a highway the wrong way and driving towards the cars going the opposite way.  So we&#8217;re like swerving trying to avoid cars and shit and im like OMG this is how it ends.  Life flashes before me, accept that death is imminent, and somehow we don&#8217;t get killed and are able to pull off the highway at some point.  I run out, find a taxi, and go home.

  <div class="entry-content"><p>After Sao Paulo Suraj took off for Floripa, and Herbert and I headed to Curitiba.  I&#8217;m not really going to say much about Curitiba because we basically didn&#8217;t do anything.  We had planned to drive to Parana (a beautiful national park area in Brazil) but due to complications with her work schedule we couldn&#8217;t work it out.  On the whole Curitiba was relaxing, a really nice city to live and work in.  Very suburban.[gallery]</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>I figured that coming to the end of the year and about the 3/4 mark of the trip it&#8217;d be worth doing a synopsis of everything that&#8217;s happened so far.  At this point I&#8217;ve been on the road for a little more than four and a half months, having left NYC August 13th.</p>

<p>I&#8217;ve been to 33 &#8220;places&#8221;, (meaning spots I&#8217;ve spent at least one night in) and 12 countries.  I think Brazil is the place I spent the most time at around 1 month and will add another 2 weeks in February.</p>

<p>Excluding the countries I actually visited, I&#8217;ve met fellow travelers from:</p>

<p>Sweeden
Denmark
Holland
England
Australia
Ireland
France
Spain
Bolivia
Scotland
Germany
Italy
Croatia
South Africa
Russia
Austria
Israel
Mexico
Bulgaria</p>

<p>Definitely the most common countries are Aussies by far, then English, Israel, then oddly Sweeden.</p>

<p>Next year I&#8217;ll be in Argentina (Mendoza, Bariloche &amp; El Calafate (Patagonia)), back to NYC for one week at the end of January.  Then two weeks in Northern Brazil and Salvador, then making my way down to Rio for carnival, then to Peru for two weeks (Lima and Cusco for Machu Pichu) then finally home to NYC with a possible stop in SF for skiing and/or Austin Texas.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>Our domestic bliss was interrupted when Herbert’s friend from law school, Suraj, joined us in Sao Paulo.  He had just finished his law school semester abroad in Buenos Aires and came to hang out for a few days.  We did a walking tour of the city checking out the tallest building in Sao Paulo, Edificio Italia, which is 43 floors high, and gives an amazing view of Sao Paulo.  You don’t really get a sense of how massive the city is until you’ve seen it from above.  It literally expands as far as the eye can see in all directions.  After that we checked out the Museum of Sao Paulo which was pretty lame with the exception of a cool graffiti exhibit.</p>

<p>Friday night we decided to hit the town hard so we made a big batch of Caipirinha’s and got some food.  Herbert passed out before we made it out so Suraj and I made plans to meet up with some kids from the hostel at a club not too far away.  When we got to the street it was a pretty sketchy street and it seemed like there was one club and everything else on the street was a strip club.  We decided to hang out with a street vendor we meet and ended up drinking on the street for hours and didn’t get into the club until 4AM.  By the time we got in the club we saw the hostel kids on their way out and most of the girls had cleared out of the club.  We had assumed the clubs would be open all night but we clearly miscalculated.  So we bounced out of the club and looked for somewhere else to go.  All the other places we went into were really broke scenes so we decided to go into a strip club to pass some time before heading home.  We planned to hang out at this strip club for probably just one drink but something bizarre was going on and we couldn’t tear ourselves away.  There were stripper poles all over the strip club, but no one stripping.  There were guys hitting on the strippers but they all acted uninterested, and were even more unapproachable than your average girl getting hit on in a normal bar.  We couldn’t figure out why the strippers would not want customers’ attention, either to sell lap dances or whatever.  It was honestly the most bizarre thing I’ve ever seen.  We tried talking to some of the strippers in my broken Portuguese and Suraj’s Spanish but we couldn’t get anywhere.  Finally, we decided to leave and I saw an American in the line to leave.  He explained that we were in a whorehouse, and there was an upstairs room where you could take the girls to have sex.  So apparently the whole thing is like the girls play hard to get and flirt with you a little bit to mirror the real chase and then they finally acquiesce and you pay them to sleep with you?  Still confused about this whole setup, but it at least makes more sense than what we had before.  <br/>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>Maya left the next day and Herbert and I settled into a life of domestic bliss.  I spent the vast majority of most days on the internet and/or doing my Pimsleur Portuguese language tapes which are surprisingly good.  Highlights included meeting Herbert’s cousin Aline, her boyfriend and some of his friends and the Jockey Club, which is like Belmont but in the middle of Sao Paulo.  It has a nice restaurant/club inside from where you can watch horse racing, although for some reason they didn’t have any races on the Sunday we were there.  Afterwards we had Pizza Rodizio which means all you can eat pizza in a similar style to a Churrascaria.  They bring around pizzas with all sorts of pizza slices (they have about 40 styles including hot dog) and just keep coming round until you are satiated.  After dinner they come around with dessert slices which looked awesome (pictured below) despite the fact that I didn’t have any because they were all chocolate.  After dinner Aline gave us a tour of the city around the famous park Ibirapuera which was all lit up for Christmas and had a giant mechanical Christmas tree.  They also took us down the main street, Avenue Paulista, through the financial district where all the big stores had great Christmas displays and in the center of the street they had big lamp posts each with happy holidays in one of the worlds’ major languages.  It was awesome to get a tour of the city by car as it’s so large it’s the only real way to see it.  [gallery]</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>The next day started with an amazing Yoga session I did with Ben and one of the guys who was working at the hostel from LA, Jason.  He was an amazing Yoga teacher, and we did X KIND OF YOGA .  I’ve done Yoga only once before, but this was by far one of the most intense mental experiences I’ve ever been through.  It was really powerful and I’d recommend anyone to give it a try.  It was much more focused on breathing and mental focus rather than physical positions.  After the Yoga I met up with Maya and Herbert, whose name is pronounced Air-bear-chee, which I just love saying, hence the title of the post.  Herbert lives in Itaim, which is a pretty affluent area of Sao Paulo.  Sao Paulo is interesting in that there are many affluent areas of the city that are still in the city but are big houses rather than apartments.  I’m not familiar with any other cities that have large housing developments in the heart of the city, and I’m not talking about things like brownstones in New York, or Compact houses in Pacific Heights in San Francisco, but full out mansions.  Herbert’s dad’s apartment was a nice small one bedroom place in a sort of condominium/hotel building.  Itaim has all sorts of nice little restaurants and shops and really high end bars/clubs and eateries.  We decided to get Sushi, but when we got to the restaurant they informed us they had ONLY salmon, so we got a giant sushi combo plate that had just salmon, it was kinda gross eating that much of one kind of fish.  The next day I convinced the girls to walk with me back to my hostel to do another Yoga session, and then we hit up the Mercado Municipal.  The market is held in what looks like a giant train station and is just awesome.  It has everything from fruit stands, to desert, to full pigs and fish to sandwiches.  I had a combo sandwich, pictured below, with steak, ham, bacon, egg, tomato, lettuce, cheese and which was definitely the best sandwich I have ever had.  The rest of the day and night passed without event and we decided to save up our energy for a big Friday night.</p>

<p>Friday night we bought some wine, cheese, Cachaca, sugar and limes so we could make Caipirinhas and have a nice pre-party before heading out.  I tried to get Tom Abreu to come out with us, but he had to bail due to a work obligation that ran late.  We got pretty soused and then headed out to Azucar which was a Samba club near our apt.  Although there are no wild stories from the night we did have a blast.  I did quite a lot of Samba dancing with both Herbert and Maya and we had fun despite sucking pretty badly.  Maya met a Brazilian guy who was moving to Boston to work for Bain and I went on a tirade telling how terrible Boston was and how sad I was that he had to leave Brazil for Boston.  Also, cultural norms being not the same in Brazil and America, this guy emailed her, literally 4 times between the time we went to bed and woke up 8 hours later.  Wild nights in Sao Paulo…

  <div class="entry-content"><p>The boys left Floripa to catch their flight and I headed to the bus station for another super comfortable bus ride back to Sao Paulo.  Please note, “super comfortable” was not said in jest here.  The busses are “executive” busses and have big reclining seats that recline enough so that you are almost horizontal.  They also show multiple decent movies along the way.  Basically this is the most comfortable way I’ve found of traveling anywhere on the globe.  Anyways…after a great overnight 12 hour bus ride, I arrived in Sao Paulo around 8 in the morning and bought a ticket to Juquehy where I was supposed to be meeting Herbert and Maya.  Luckily I sat down to check my email and found out that the hotel they were staying at refused to allow me to stay in the room with them.  So rather than going up there to meet them and getting my own hotel I decided to stay in the city and get a hostel for the night.  I took the metro to the Limetime hostel, which btw was a lot of fun and would recommend to anyone in Sao Paulo who likes to party.  The metro in Sao Paulo was surprisingly good.  The trains came extremely frequently, and there were little designated areas where people queued up to enter the train.  When the train stopped, one side of the train would open and people could exit, and the other side would open and people could enter, brilliant.  The problem with the metro is that it only service a tiny portion of the city, if I had to guess I’d say less than 30% of the geographic area.  Now given, the city is monstrous, but it’s pretty absurd not to have a functioning metro in a city of 16+ million people.  This leads to my next aside which is that the traffic in Sao Paulo beats any city hands down.  New York, Houston, LA, all take a backseat to Sao Paulo.  It took me over an hour to go 5 kilometers in a taxi within two normal parts of the city, not even in “El Centro”.  I arrived at my hostel with surprisingly few problems, using my absolutely piss poor Portuguese to navigate my way through the subways, switching trains and ending up at the right destination.  The hostel was in Bella Vista which was a nice part of town near a big Mall and a number of decent places to eat.</p>

<p>I unpacked my stuff, wasted the day away catching up on the internet, grabbed some food, and then started meeting people at the hostel.  I met a couple cool Australian girls, a French Canadian girl, an Australian guy who spoke fluent Portuguese and worked at the hostel, a Croatian girl, and a bunch of other randos.  The back part of the hostel had a big café/bar area where they served beers and caipirinhas.  It was the best bar setup of any hostels I’ve been to and facilitated a nice social atmosphere even for those who weren’t planning on going out.  The Australian guy, Ben, had two Brazillian girls coming over and they had VIP passes so we could go to some club called Heaven that had a 150 Reais (80 USD) cover but we’d get in free with the passes.  So we chilled at the bar with the girls, drank a bunch of Caipirinhas and then headed to the club around 2AM.  The club scene was kinda weak, although not bad I guess given it being a Wednesday night.  In contrast to Floripa, there was a 3:1 guy to girl ratio, the girls were good looking, but not astounding, and drinks were 25 Reais a piece.  My inability to speak Portuguese was once again a killer as Ben was able to entertain the girls all night and I stood there like a mute.  All in all the night was a lot of fun, a lot of other people from the hostel ended up joining us, and we all danced until around 6AM.  One interesting note was that in Floripa and Rio, guys standard game seemed to be grabbing girls, talking to them or dancing with them for 5 minutes, and then making out with them.  In Sao Paulo, maybe because it’s more of a working rather than party city, it seemed more like New York.  Guys would approach girls more cautiously, and chat with them for a long time before trying to dance with them, and there were very few people making out at the club.  So I didn’t feel as lame leaving without a girl that night.<br/>
