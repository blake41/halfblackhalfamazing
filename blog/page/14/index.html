  <div class="entry-content"><p>Woke up early to do the Campuan Ridge hike which takes you north through the village  of Pagoya and back to town.  I was hoping this hike would be a little more rugged, but it ended up being more of a stroll down some streets through a town.  There were a few parts that went through some beautiful rice paddies but for the most part I was a bit disappointed.  Nothing like Hong Kong or China.  After the hike we stopped at the Fly Café which had amazing food.  I had some killer key lime pie, caramel pancakes and pepperoni pizza.  After that Mike and I went on an epic search for acupuncture as I had seen brochures for it and had always wanted to try it and Mike’s stomach had been hurting him for days.  Unfortunately we confused acupressure massage with acupuncture and ran around to every spa in Ubud before we realized our mistake.  Finally we found an alternative medicine clinic who did acupuncture.  It was a pretty cool experience.  I didn’t have any particular ailments I wanted treated other than a sore lower back and neck so she gave me the acupuncture to restore energy and get your chi flowing correctly.  I was curious whether or not the needles would hurt and they definitely did a little bit but not too bad.  I got one in the heel, knee, stomach, wrist and elbow on both left and right of my front side, and you sit for 15 minutes while they work.  You can definitely feel the blood coursing through your body during this time and it feels pretty cool.  Mike got like 20 needles in his stomach which was pretty hilarious.  Then we turned over and I got about 6 in my neck, 10 in the lower back and one behind each knee.  The back needles felt really good, and by the end I had almost fallen asleep I was so relaxed.  After Acupuncture I headed out to get a back neck and shoulder massage at Eve Spa which was delightful and cost 5 USD.  Adam and I headed to do a meditation class at 6 but the head guy was headed to some event and class was closed that night.  We headed over to the Yoga House to see if we could do a Yoga class but we had just missed the class and the only thing left was a class called “Just Dance” a two hour unled improvisational dance.  Not exactly what I had in mind for my man date.    We headed over to the Jazz Café which was the highlight of my stay in Ubud.  They had live Jazz and raised seating overlooking the band but you sat on the floor on pillows against the wall.  It was a gorgeous open air setup with pictures of famous jazz musicians all along the walls.  The band was 4 Balinesian guys and started off with a little Eric Clapton.  They played covers all night and the lead singer had an incredible voice which sounded just like BB King.  It was pretty cool to see that voice coming out of this tiny Balinesian man.  Dinner was spectacular, by far the best food we’ve had in Bali.  I had Chicken stuffed with feta cheese and sundried tomatoes, and we got bruschetta, bread with feta cheese butter dip, calamari, and Balinese chili dip with bread.  We added a couple beers to dinner and it was about all you can ask for a meal.  Cost: 20 USD per person.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>We decided to get out of Kuta and follow the advice of four French guys we met at our hotel and head to Ubud and then around the north east part of the island heading towards Padangbai.  Suffice it to say the last night in Kuta was crazy, and one of the most interesting nights on the trip but it won’t be discussed on the blog.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>Kuta wears on you pretty quickly as it is loud and crowded constantly.  We decided to check out Seminyak which we had heard was way more chill and more upscale.  We checked out the Anantara Resort right on Seminyak beach for some drinks.  Seminyak is soooo much nicer than Kuta.  The minute you cross the border the shops immediately become more upscale and everything relaxes quite a bit.  The resort was gorgeous and we got a nice table overlooking the beach and had some drinks.  We then headed to a pretty nice restaurant, Rumours, for dinner.  Had pretty good food and we headed home sleepy and satiated.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>I did a little shopping today, looking for some presents for friends back home.  I went to a little store that had some cool stuff and started bargaining for two items.  &#8220;How much for two?&#8221; &#8220;350,000 for one she replied.&#8221;  I smiled and laughed because we both knew she was full of sh*t.  &#8220;100,000 for two I countered.&#8221;  &#8220;No no this is the new kind she said.&#8221;  I started laughing because we both knew there were shops everywhere selling the exact same things I was trying to buy.  &#8220;I like you&#8221; she told me, &#8221; how about 150,000 and a kiss?&#8221;  &#8220;Done&#8221;.  So I gave her a little kiss on the cheek, and thus my first kiss in Bali was to a cute little 40 year old woman.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>Surfed Kuta Reef which was really cool.  You take a boat out to a break maybe 5 minutes out by boat.  The wave was a gorgeous left that was steep and peeled all the way down the line.  Best day of surf I&#8217;ve ever had.  Absolutely shredded some waves including an overhead set wave.  What a cool experience.<img src="http://halfblackhalfamazing.files.wordpress.com/2009/08/imgp2570.jpg" alt="IMGP2570" /></p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>Had  pretty terrible day of surf at Kuta Beach.  Caught only a few waves due to crowds, tons of longboarders and shitty waves.  Meg (my old roomate from Hawaii) joined us from Australia.  She rolled in late, we grabbed some beers and hit the streets.  Daniel, or Balinesian friend came out with us as well.  We checked out Skygarden which was pretty uneventful except for this&#8230;<img src="http://halfblackhalfamazing.files.wordpress.com/2009/08/img_0102.jpg" alt="Go Go Dancers" />Four Balinesian girls came out and did a sick little dance number behind the bar and then danced on the bars.  Maybe the most amazing legs I have ever seen.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>We landed in Bali after having not slept in Hong Kong the night before and sleeping about 6 hours on planes during the journey from Hong Kong to Bali.  We hadn’t gotten a hotel because most hotels in Bali don’t book online.  We stopped at the hotel booking place in the hotel and tried to find a cheap hotel but since it’s high season everything reasonable was booked.  We got a hotel for 400,000 Rupieh which is about 40 USD in Kuta.  We hopped in a cab and headed to the hotel.  Kuta looked similarly to what I had expected.  The main strip (Legian street) is really built up and is surf shops, souvenir shops and bars/resturants.  This place is truly the surfers paradise.  I have never seen such a concentration of surf culture in one place.  Everyone you see here is decked out in only surf brands and has the long shaggy blonde surfer ‘do.  Also, all the girls here are gorgeous from the locals to the tourists.  I think I may have died and gone to heaven.</p>

<p>After we checked into our hotel we went on a search for boards to rent.  We walked down Poppies lane where we were told all the surf shops would be, but every shop that sold boards did not rent, and the few we discovered that did rent had sh*tty boards for too much.  Finally we met a local named Daniel who brought us to his friend Yopi’s shop and we found the board selection we were looking for.  Leigh and I both rented 7’ 2” fun boards for 35,000 R (3.50 USD) a day which were pretty dope.  Yopi’s shop was awesome and everyone was so cool.  They invited us to join them for drinks and we drank whisky and coke which is the cheapest way to drink on the island.  Amazingly, Yopi came to Bali from the jungle in Sumatra where he wore only a loincloth until 4 years ago.  The tsunami actually carried him to Bali on a tree, not joking, and he has been here ever since.  He loves Bali and speaks near perfect English.  The third member of their crew was Rama who was real chill and played the guitar while we all chilled out.  Danielle told us to join him at Kuta beach the next day where he teaches surfing and he said we could leave our boards at his rack on the beach and go walk around after we were done surfing.  I can’t get over how nice and cool everyone is here.  After renting the boards we headed to grab some dinner on Legian street and stopped at a nice open air restaurant.  Of course I fell in love with our waitress who was an absolute goddess but unfortunately she had a ring on.  After dinner we were pretty exhausted and headed to bed.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>Now that we have transportation and a good sense of the place I wanted to head to a better break.  Leigh decided to stay at Kuta Beach for another day to get back in the swing of things and I headed down south to Uluwatu.  I hopped on my moped for a drive that I was told would be about 45 minutes with no map and some vague directions from a guy we met at breakfast.  Driving a moped in Bali is insane but I am happy to report that I now can drive like a Balinese which means I am f*cking insane driver.  On the way back from Ulus I got the moped up to 100 km/h which is about 60 mph and was weaving through traffic.  So fun, and so stupid, but that’s kind of the point.  I got to Uluwatu without too much trouble although I made one wrong turn, parked my bike and walked down towards the break.  When I got to the break I was filled equally with two emotions: sheer terror, and pure joy.  The “town” that surrounds the break “Ulus” is built on a cliff about 200 feet up, and there are a bunch of rock piers you can walk out on and watch the waves break.  Ulus has got to be the most beautiful wave I have ever seen, even prettier than Pipeline on the north shore of Oahu.  I am goofy footed which means my natural wave breaks left and Ulus is all lefts.  The wave fires in constant sets and break in about 4 spots along a massive reef hundreds of yards long.  It took me about 30 minutes to work up the courage to paddle out and once I did I was so nervous I forgot my reef booties and sunscreen.</p>

<p>Ulus was really crowded but there was one break on the furthest left that was breaking slightly smaller with 75% less people so I headed that way.  The big set waves were coming in about 9 feet with a lot of water, comparable to anything I’d seen on Oahu except for Sunset Beach.  Let me interject here, is there anything sexier than seeing a hot girl paddle into the lineup and catch a win a wave over like 30 dudes?  That was a rhetorical question, the answer is no.  I finally got a wave about 30 minutes in about head high, made a nice drop in and was immediately ripped off my board by the lip of the wave.  The first few waves I caught the same thing happened until I realized I had to move down the first section a lot faster and started setting my board across the wave initially as I dropped in.  The highlight of the day was one of the hottest surfer girls I’ve ever seen paddling past me towards the big break.  I tried to make conversation with her but is any girl going to talk to a guy surfing the little break while she’s surfing the big break?  It’s like bringing a knife to a gunfight.</p>

<p>Scorecard:
45 minutes to Ulus
0 falls
1 drop in close out
3 drop in didn’t make the next section
2 long beautiful rides (priceless)</p>

<p>After about 3 hours we were well past high tide and the waves had dropped to about shoulder high I decided to paddle in.  I caught a wave in and headed towards the small alcove between the cliffs.  Unfortunately I hadn’t really thought out my exit as there was a strong current (approx 3 knots) that pulled you straight past the alcove.  I almost made the alcove but missed and almost got thrown into the rocks.  I started to paddle back out again but the current quickly dragged me much further past the alcove.  As I looked down the cliffs I couldn’t see any more beaches as far as I could see.  At this point I was one hundred yards past the alcove getting further and further away by the second.  A wave of pure panic passed over me and I started to paddle for my life as I realized that I was quickly going to get sucked out to sea and die because I was alone and no one would know to come looking for me.  Even at full strength I couldn’t make any headway back towards the alcove.  I realized I had about 30 seconds to do something before I was headed towards a likely sea death.  I sat on my board and tried to relax and think.  I looked towards the cliffs and saw a small section of sand about 3 feet by 3 feet.  I decided to paddle back out, catch a wave and take it at the beach.  I did just that and successfully made it to the beach.  I laid down on the beach absolutely exhausted and decided to rest for a while and figure out a plan.  At this point I saw a girl getting sucked past the alcove and started to panic that she was going to die as well.  She was about 300 yards past the takeout point so I quickly threw my board on the rocks and scrambled along the cliff to see if I could get her attention and help her.  I couldn’t get her attention and I decided I had to get back ASAP so I could get some help for her.  However, after watching her for 10 minutes I realized she was smart, and was paddling out to sea to get out of the current.  She finally made it out of the current and started making good headway back to the takeout point.  I then remembered that the tide was going out, and that my small beach and cliffs, would soon become a large beach and path to the takeout point.  I chilled out for half and hour and then anticlimactically strolled out.</p>

<p>After some lunch and picture taking I headed home ecstatic to have conquered Ulus and escaped with my life.  I met up with Leigh at Kuta Beach and then headed back to the hotel.  I got an hour massage at the same place as the day before and then met Bain and his two friends Adam and Mike and Leigh at dinner.  After dinner we decided to get some beers and hang out at our hotel’s pool which was open till midnight.  At the pool we met some gorgeous Russian girls who told us they were there in a big group from Moscow of about 25 people.  They were all really cool and a lot of them were on mushrooms.  We had a blast kicking it with them and Leigh fell in love with an insanely gorgeous girl Anya (of course).  I am in love with the girl who was kind of the leader of the pack of Russian girls although she has a boyfriend.  Went to bed at midnight with plans to kick it with the girls the next day at Kuta Beach or Dinner/Out.  One of the best days of my life.</p>

<p>-Juice Out</p>

<p>P.S. I have also taken up drinking tea, and smoking cigarettes and getting up early.  It’s pretty hard not to smoke when you are travelling internationally because all cute girls smoke and the easiest way to start conversation with them is to ask for a cigarette.</p>

<p>P.P.S. Leigh reported that he killed it at Kuta Beach catching about 25+ waves.  I am stoked about this because maybe he will stop being such a p*ssy and come surf real waves with me at some point this trip.  Aaaaand, after a whole day without sunblock I might be darker than Darnell now.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>Woke up at the crack of dawn so we could get a head start on the day as there was still much to do.  We walked down to the beach to check out the surf and it looked significantly better than we had been told it would.  We did a little shopping and picked up some local tank tops as that’s what everyone wears here.  We grabbed breakfast at our hotel and then went to try and find a more reasonably priced hotel.  For some reason in Indonesia hotels don’t really keep records of who is coming and going, so hotels are either full or have rooms, and the ones that are full can’t tell you when they are not going to be full.  So between 9-11AM during the checkout time, you walk around and stop at each hotel you see and ask if anyone has checked out.  If they have, it’s first come first serve.  We were lucky enough to find a hotel that after some badgering grudgingly admitted someone would be checking out that day and was willing to rent us a room.  It’s 120,000 R a night (12 USD) for a nice hotel with a pool, a room with two beds, shower, fan and Lanai.  Pretty unbelievable deal.  We then rented mopeds from the hotel which are 35,000 R a day plus 10,000 insurance.  They come with solid surf racks that allow you to go on the highway with a board.  The perfect means of transport.  Luckily, while we waited for the mopeds to arrive, I was reading a copy of Lonely Planet that was laying on the table which clued us in to the fact that we needed drivers licenses.  So we headed to the police station to get licenses.</p>

<p>The police station was quite an adventure.  The cops spoke the worst English of anyone we had yet met on the island and we finally conveyed that we needed licenses.  We were offered the option of a paper license, or a card, the paper for 100,000 R each, or the card for 400,000, so of course we went with paper.  We filled out forms that seemed to be a stolen property report but were assured they just needed our information to process the license.  When it was all typed up it finally dawned on us what was going on.  They were selling us a signed affidavit from the police station which said our international driving permits had been stolen the day before.  This affidavit allows us to drive as long as we want here.  What a great system.</p>

<p>Now that we had transportation we loaded up the boards and headed to the beach.  The waves were about shoulder high and really clean despite it being insanely crowded.  We headed out to one of the breaks on Kuta beach and charged in.  I caught 4 waves during our first session 3 of which closed out and one of which I rode all the way to the beach.  I was pretty pumped given that I hadn’t surfed in 2 years.  After a few hours we headed up to the beach to grab some food.  We looked for Daniel near the Ocean Beach Club were he said his rack was and sure enough he was there waiting to store our boards for us.  He then took us to a street meat vendor on the beach which had amazing local food for 15,000 R.  I got a hamburger with some kind of spicy sauce, lettuce, tomato, bacon and an egg on top, and Leigh and I both got a dish of friend rice.  Best meal I’ve had in a while and it cost 30,000 R.  Pretty insane.  Since Daniel was nice enough to look after our boards we were able to take a stroll down the beach to check out the breezies.  The women in Bali are truly insane.  From Europeans, to Aussies to the local flavor I have never seen such a collection of gorgeous women anywhere in the world.  I may never make it off this island.</p>

<p>Oddly, in Bali, the surf is only good around high tide which was around noon so it got progressively smaller all day preventing us from doing the afternoon session we had planned on.  Instead we walked across the street to the Ocean Beach Club which is a very modern resort style club.  They have big tables with couch/lounge style seating with a big pool and a big deck.  We lounged on the couches for a few hours while drinking the local beer Bintang which is delicious and well priced.  We headed to our hotel to get cleaned up and take a swim and met 4 pretty chill French dudes.  They weren’t surfers but gave us some good tips on what to see in the more cultural northern parts of Bali which we plan on hitting at some point.  We then headed into town to grab some Sushi.  We found an amazing sushi place that cost us less than 200,000 R for two people, drinks and a boatload of Sushi.  After dinner I decided to get a massage as they are only 50,000 R here!  Of course I fell in love with my massage therapist again.  Her name was Ayu, was from Bali and was so beautiful.  The massage was amazing and I tipped her 50,000 R bringing the total cost of an hour massage to 10 USD.  Ayu told me to come back tomorrow which I most certainly will be doing.  I also am planning on taking her out to dinner so I can ask her to marry me.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>We landed in Bali after having not slept in Hong Kong the night before and sleeping about 6 hours on planes during the journey from Hong Kong to Bali.  We hadn’t gotten a hotel because most hotels in Bali don’t book online.  We stopped at the hotel booking place in the hotel and tried to find a cheap hotel but since it’s high season everything reasonable was booked.  We got a hotel for 400,000 Rupieh which is about 40 USD in Kuta.  We hopped in a cab and headed to the hotel.  Kuta looked similarly to what I had expected.  The main strip (Legian street) is really built up and is surf shops, souvenir shops and bars/resturants.  This place is truly the surfers paradise.  I have never seen such a concentration of surf culture in one place.  Everyone you see here is decked out in only surf brands and has the long shaggy blonde surfer ‘do.  Also, all the girls here are gorgeous from the locals to the tourists.  I think I may have died and gone to heaven.</p>

<p>After we checked into our hotel we went on a search for boards to rent.  We walked down Poppies lane where we were told all the surf shops would be, but every shop that sold boards did not rent, and the few we discovered that did rent had sh*tty boards for too much.  Finally we met a local named Daniel who brought us to his friend Yopi’s shop and we found the board selection we were looking for.  Leigh and I both rented 7’ 2” fun boards for 35,000 R (3.50 USD) a day which were pretty dope.  Yopi’s shop was awesome and everyone was so cool.  They invited us to join them for drinks and we drank whisky and coke which is the cheapest way to drink on the island.  Amazingly, Yopi came to Bali from the jungle in Sumatra where he wore only a loincloth until 4 years ago.  The tsunami actually carried him to Bali on a tree, not joking, and he has been here ever since.  He loves Bali and speaks near perfect English.  The third member of their crew was Rama who was real chill and played the guitar while we all chilled out.  Danielle told us to join him at Kuta beach the next day where he teaches surfing and he said we could leave our boards at his rack on the beach and go walk around after we were done surfing.  I can’t get over how nice and cool everyone is here.  After renting the boards we headed to grab some dinner on Legian street and stopped at a nice open air restaurant.  Of course I fell in love with our waitress who was an absolute goddess but unfortunately she had a ring on.  After dinner we were pretty exhausted and headed to bed.</p>
