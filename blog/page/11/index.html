  <div class="entry-content"><p>The first day of Scuba class was pretty boring as it mainly consisted of watching terrible PADI videos and taking tests.  Class got out around dinnertime and I headed to dinner with my group.  There&#8217;s 5 of us in the group including myself, two Israeli boy/girl twins, a girl from Poland, and an English kid.  It&#8217;s a good group and everyone seems nice and friendly.  We all walked into Suri beach which is the little town near our dive resort.  The town is pretty beautiful at night decorated with all sorts of colored lights and hanging lanterns along a small path.  I ran into Rachel, the girl who introduced me to Gary the bunny and I kicked it with her and Adam and Gary for a few hours at the bar that she works at (AC bar).  Tarik, a Burmese guy who works for the bar was doing fire dancing outside on the beach so I went outside to watch him.  Rachel asked me if I wanted to give it a try and I was stoked.  Tarik gave me some lessons and after some practice without fire I pimped a little Fire Dancing show that I was pretty impressed with for my first time.  Definitely need to get better at this as the sh*t.  The moves that Tarik could do looked so badass.

  <div class="entry-content"><p>Although my first full day in Thailand consisted of traveling all day, it was much better than the day before.  I watched the first season of Californication while a taxi took me to Surat Thani from Phuket where I boarded an overnight sleeper boat to Ko Tao.  I had about 4 hours to wait before the boat took off, so I decided to drink some beers.  I met three Americans and one German who had made a similar decision and were headed to Ko Tao as well.  The Americans were from Seattle and one had been on the road for two years.  He has dual American/Euro citizenship which made me insanely jealous because he&#8217;s allowed to work in any country in the EU.  On the boat I met two English sisters who had moved visited Ko Tao 6 months ago and just decided to stay.  They had come back to the mainland to buy rabbits who they named Gary and Neil.  The rabbits were so awesome, the most chilled out bunnies I&#8217;ve ever seen.  Gary kicked in my pocket and fell asleep there.  He is awesome, and I plan to go visit him at the bar where the girls work later today.<img src="http://halfblackhalfamazing.files.wordpress.com/2009/09/img_0703.jpg" alt="Gary and Me" /></p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>Pretty Epicly bad start to my time in Thailand.  9 Hour flight, 2 hour delay put me in the airport in Phuket at 11PM.  The money changer tried to rip me off giving me around 120 USD less than I was supposed to get.  I didn&#8217;t question it because I&#8217;ve never had a legit currency exchange in an airport try to rip me off.  When I got outside I did the math and had to go back through airport security and caught them just as they were leaving.  Thank god they didn&#8217;t put up a fight and just gave me what they shorted me.  Welcome to Thailand.  After that my minibus driver said he would take me to my hotel but once we got into town and drove around a while he said he didn&#8217;t know where it was.  Luckily another woman in the minibus owned a hotel and offered to let me use her phone/internet to find my hotel and let me stay at hers if worst came to worst.  I finally found my hotel at around 130AM and so ended a long first day/night in Thailand.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>I just watched a Jim Carey movie called Yes Man.  It’s of the general variety of kitchy pretty bad movies that he’s churned out over the years.  However, I really enjoyed it as I think the message of the movie is a positive one.  Say yes to everything.  I’ve been trying to do this as much as I can on this trip.  If you’re reading this blog, you probably know me pretty well, and I don’t think anyone would ever accuse me of being closed minded, or the type of person who’s reluctant to try new things (except for food).  Despite that, I’m trying to keep my mind open to new experiences and be even more open minded than I normally would.  And I think, say yes to everything is a pretty good guiding principle for this trip.  So I’m going to put myself out there as much as possible and say yes to as many different things as possible.  I’ve been trying to convince a bunch of different people to come meet me at the end of the trip in South America, and I’m hoping they will be as apt to say yes and come join as I am on my journey.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>There’s something about zoos, and animals in general that I think brings out the kid in everyone.  As I rode the cable car up to the top of the zoo I passed over some elephants rolling around in the mud.  I literally laughed out loud.  There’s something about elephants that’s both awe inspiring and magical.  They seem so chill and human like they just make you laugh.  Being at the zoo made me feel like a kid again.  I can’t remember the last time I was at the zoo.  I wasn’t even sure what animals I have seen in real life.  Being at the zoo by myself was also awesome because I’ve never had the freedom to skip the boring animals, and just spend time with the cool ones because I’d always been taken to the zoo by a school trip, or parents who insist on it being an educational rather than fun experience.</p>

<p>The highlight of the Taronga zoo was without question, the lions.  Have you ever seen a lion up close in real life?  They are so f*cking badass I was jumping up and down in excitement.  There were two male and two female lions and at one point the alpha Male just starting roaring at the top of his lungs, which got all the other lions fired up and the other male joined in and then the females followed suit and all four of them got together and were just screaming their faces off.  It was so cool.  My second favorite animal was the Tiger.  It’s just an amazingly beautiful animal, although it just laid on it’s bed, must have had a big day.  The gorillas and monkeys were also really cool as it’s remarkable how human they seem.  They play just like little kids and just seem to be having a great time fooling around.  The elephants were pretty awesome, and it got me stoked to ride/play with some in Thailand and Laos.  I’ve heard the places where you can see them and play with them are pretty unbelievable and it got me really excited to get up close and personal with such an interesting animal.  It was also interesting to see Kangaroos as I’d never seen them before, but being zoo animals they were all pretty bored and just kind of laid there and didn’t really hop around like I had expected.  Lastly, the koala bear is the cutest animal on the planet.  Hands down.  I wanted to steal one and put it in my suitcase and just pet it forever.  What an awesome animal.</p>

<p>The aquarium was not as cool as the zoo.  There were a lot of pretty boring fish that seem to just be there because they are fish you’ve never seen, but very few were pretty or cool looking.  The highlights of the aquarium were the sharks which were really badass, the Manta and Eagle Rays (It’s incredible how big these guys are), and the platypus just because he’s such a silly looking little swimmer.

  <div class="entry-content"><p>Sydney is not a good place to go if you are looking for a crazy adventure.  The city is beautiful, and IMHO one of the best places to live.  The beaches are beautiful, the surf is good, and the city itself is vibrant and very accessible.  I think it’s a pretty good combination of everything I liked about living in Honolulu, and everything I like about New York.  While it isn’t the best at anything, it’s good at everything.</p>

<p>Unfortunately while I was in Sydney I was mostly here to work, get my Brazilian visa, and resolve my lost wallet crisis in Bali.  Despite my limited time to explore, I did get to do a few cool things in Sydney.  My roommate and a few of her friends took me kayaking in Rose Bay and we kayaked to some rocks where you can go cliff jumping.  The water is pretty icy cold as they are just finishing winter, but it was a beautiful 30 degree celcius day out and it was fun despite the cold water.  A good friend of mine from Hawaii also took me to one of her kickboxing classes.  If you’ve never done kickboxing before, you should definitely try it.  It’s both an awesome workout, and so much fun.  They had a great mix they played while you are doing it, finishing off with the Mortal Kombat song which got me so fired up.</p>

<p>All in all Sydney was a good experience, but by the time my time here was almost up, I was pretty ready to leave.  Sydney is great, but outside of the funny way people talk, and driving on the wrong side of the road, you forget you’re even “travelling.”  You feel like you are in any American city.  I know I’m going to get torn apart by all the people who love Australia, so I want to qualify this with the fact that I love Sydney, it’s just not that much different than America, and when it’s bookended by Bali and Thailand, it kind of pales in comparison as far as the foreignness and the magic of being in a new place.  I’d love to get back to Australia at some point to see the great barrier reef, do some surfing when it’s warmer, and explore more of the natural beauty of the country.

  <div class="entry-content"><p>One of the biggest things I was curious to discover, and experience first hand was racism in Australia compared to in the US.  One of the things I’ve always heard about Australia is how racist it is.  However, my experience was quite the opposite.  I felt more comfortable in Australia than in a lot of places in the US.  I also asked the Indian girl I went out with what her thoughts were and she didn’t think there was any racism in Australia.  I think that should be taken with a grain of salt given that she is a particularly attractive girl and therefore I would guess significantly less likely to experience racism no matter where she is.  I also asked two Aussies who were bankers, about my age, basically the same demographic as most of my friends in NY.  They felt that there was no racism, and if anything America was much more racist.  A Jewish American girl who was part of this discussion totally disagreed and felt that while she didn’t feel any overt anti Semitism she did feel like there was a lack of exposure of most Aussie’s which caused her to feel uncomfortable expressing her religion.  So there is my statistically insignificant sample of racism in Australia.  Take it for what you will.</p>
