  <div class="entry-content"><p>As I travel I subconsciously expect every place I visit to be a substandard version of whatever we have in America.  And yet almost everywhere I go countries have better versions of things we have, or just straight up things that we should have, that we don’t.  In China, the availability of public toilets is remarkable.  How do we not have this in major cities like NYC?  I mean you can always run into Starbucks but they shouldn’t have to subsidize the entire NYC public.  The subways in Hong Kong, Shanghai, and Tokyo are remarkably better than in NYC.  They are cleaner, more often, and the signage is dramatically better.  Each platform has a sign saying the stop you are on, and the next stop in each direction, with the incorrect direction stop greyed out.  This makes it near impossible to get on a train going the wrong way, because you can see your stop greyed out.  The airports in KL, Shanghai and Mumbai all had free wireless all over the airport.  How do all airports not have this! Wireless at the airport is approaching a necessity.  The ability to change plans from the airport, rent a car, get a hotel, look up information are paramount when you are travelling.  It’s a crime that we don’t have this.  Also, the bullet train network in Japan, as well as the ability to use phones and the internet on the subway are remarkable.  Again, America is well behind in these respects.  That is a short list off the top of my head of things that other countries have gotten right, that we have not.  Can&#8217;t wait to set up my Mao statue when I get back to NYC.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>Iris told me that the news in China is pretty hilarious.  Its 30 minutes, and it airs every evening.  The first 10 minutes detail all the great things the government did that day.  The second 10 minutes detail how happy all the people in China are.  And the third 10 minutes show how much suffering and unhappiness there is in the Western world.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>I just wanted to note that I am really curious what it is like to be a gay person in China or the rest of Asia.  As far as I saw, there aren’t really any gays in China.  This is clearly false, but I’m wondering if they are very repressed and not as flamboyant as in America, or all relegated to certain areas?</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>I just wanted to note that it has felt so great being the tallest person everywhere I go.  When I get on a subway, I’m at least a head taller than just about everyone on the train.  It makes me feel like a giant badass.  Just wanted to share that.  If you’re a short guy, come to China/Japan and feel like a baller.</p>

<p>The negative to this is all doorways are built like 6 inches to a foot shorter.  I&#8217;ve banged my head an innumerable amount of times.  You&#8217;d think you&#8217;d adjust to it, but you&#8217;d be wrong.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>It seems that in China, they don’t have the same cultural prohibitions on staring.  Everywhere I go I am met with stares and gawking.  I imagine I get this more than most westerners because I have dark skin and it’s probably pretty rare that they see a wealthy dark westerner travelling through their country.  However, it never ceases to amuse me how much people stare over here.  Also, usually in the states if you catch someone staring they will look away when they get caught.  However, over here, they just keep staring.  Pretty funny.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>My time in Beijing was a crazy blur.  I literally only spent 27 hours in Beijing but got a remarkable amount accomplished in 1 day.  I took a cab to the bus station at 8AM and hopped on the great wall tourist bus.  They leave every 10 minutes and are cheap (12RMB) and incredibly convenient to visit the wall.  The Great Wall literally sent chills down my spine.  It’s something I’ve always wanted to see, and pictures just don’t do it justice.  First off I didn’t realize they had built it through mountains.  It sprawls across a huge mountain range with dramatic changes in elevation so steep at points you really need to hold the handrail as you walk along so that you down slip and go head over heels down the incline.  I spent a couple hours walking around on it and was dead tired by the time I got back to the bus station.  It makes you wonder how many millions of man hours and lives were lost completing such a massive undertaking.  How they did it without any modern tools is just beyond me.<br/>
After the wall I headed back to town and caught a short cab to the forbidden city.  The forbidden city was cool, but after having seen like 10 million temples over the past month or two, I wasn’t blown away.  It’s definitely worth seeing if you are in Beijing, and is really impressive, I just got kinda bored quickly.<br/>
I headed back to my hotel around 5PM and Iris, the Chinese girl I’d met in the KL airport, came to pick me up around 6.  We went to eat at this famous restaurant called Quan Ju De which is right by this really beautiful lake Shi Cha Hai.  I was really glad she took me here as dinner was awesome, the show was awesome, and the area in general was just really cool.  After dinner we walked around the area, down two very famous streets called Nan Luo Gu Xiang and &#8220;The Skewed Tobacco Pouch Street.&#8221;  After that we cruised over to the Olympic park to see the two big stadiums but they are only lit up until 9PM so they were significantly less cool looking without the lighting, but still nice to see them.  We also saw this building that was built to look like a Dragon near Olympic park called Pan Gu.  It&#8217;s a pretty cool looking building for sure.
After the Olympic park I was challenged to a little Karaoke competition because Iris did not believe I was a good singer.  Plus, you got to do Karaoke when you are in Asia.  So we headed to Mai Le Di to tear it up.  I got a 6 pack of Tiger beers and we rented a private room and tore up the karaoke machine.  Needless to say she was pretty impressed with my karaoke skills.  Had planned on going out after my dinner with Iris but it was 3am by the time I got home so I just hit the sack immediately as I had to be up at 530AM to get to the airport for my flight to Tokyo.

  <div class="entry-content"><p>In my conversations with Iris, the Chinese girl who showed me around Beijing, it occurred to me that the American machine has almost as much propaganda as China.  When I told Iris I would be in Beijing on Thursday, she was like oh I can’t drive on Thursday till after 8PM, which of course made me laugh.  I asked why not and she said traffic control.  What is traffic control?  Well if you have a 1 or a 0 at the end of your license plate you can’t drive on Thursdays because Beijing has too many cars and this is how they reduce the amount of cars on the road.  This made me laugh because it was such a typically communist way to handle a problem.  Oh this is not working? Ok these people are no longer allowed to do that.  I explained that in America this would never be allowed.  How do you handle the problem she inquired?  I explained that we would use taxes, to create a disincentive to drive.  I gave the recently proposed tax to drive into Manhattan during the week as an example.  She pointed out that both methods solve the problem, except one distributes the burden equally among all citizens, whereas our solution would benefit the rich most, as they would be spending a smaller amount of their income if they wanted to use the road, and poor people would probably not be able to afford it.  It’s not as if this had never occurred to me, as a matter of fact it was the main reason the proposed tax failed, but it was kind of revolutionary to think that really these are just two approaches to the same problem.  Each would have potential positives and negatives, and a more logical approach, would be to consider both like I would any proposals, rather than dismissing one out of hand as being communist and therefore stupid.  I am about as staunch a libertarian as you will find in America, being an econ major and spending too much time reading business literature, but it just made me step back and think about all the other capitalist/American ideas had been pounded into my head for so long that I never took time to acknowledge that there are other ways of looking at things, and maybe I/WE might have some things wrong.
On a similar note, I have had to speak for America everywhere I go.  I often get pulled into political debates with people from other countries because I am the first intelligent American they have met and they want me to speak to why America does this, or why America does that.  In most cases I try and give the most reasoned out answer I can and try and explain why in many cases, things we do may not make at first glance the most sense, but here is at least the history and reasoning behind this or that.  I also explain, that in most cases I agree with them, and their countries views, and that in most cases I think what we are doing in this or that circumstance is foolish, but as a democracy, I have little direct power to change it.  The biggest thing I’ve had to answer for is healthcare.  People all around the world look at us and laugh, and can’t believe that we can’t figure this out.  We spend more money than anyone on healthcare by double in many cases, and still leave our poor people to die in the streets.  How can such a rich country justify this?  This is where I am most often left without words, and really ashamed to be an American.  If all these other poorer countries have figured this out, it’s criminal that we haven’t/can’t.  I hope Obama can fix this.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>I had to get to the airport for a 9 oclock flight so I promised myself I’d be at the airport 3 hours early to make sure I wouldn’t miss another flight.  Billings suggested I check out the French Concession and it was a great recommendation.  It’s an amazingly beautiful part of the city, very European feel to the whole area.  I chilled out for a while at a nice park and just walked down the streets taking pics and chilling.  I headed back towards my hotel around 4PM feeling glorious and satisfied that I had conquered Shanghai.  After grabbing my bags I headed to catch the Maglev train.  The Maglev train is so cool.  Every major city should have one.  It takes 8 minutes to get to the airport using it and It maxes out at 430km/hr.  It’s pretty wild to zoom out of the city at that speed.  I got to the airport later than I had planned but still with plenty of time to catch my flight (7PM).  However, once I got there, I realized I had pulled the all time biggest boneheaded move of my life.  It turns out that there are 2 airports in Shanghai, and I was at the wrong one for my flight.  Amazingly, Shanghai airlines was able to get me onto a Eastern China Airlines flight only 40 minutes after my flight flying out of the airport I was at.  I assume they were able to do this because all the airlines are owned by the gov’t, but I was just shocked at how easily the problem was resolved.  I’m pretty sure in America I just would have been fucked.  The flight into Beijing went without a hitch and I arrive safe and sound at my hotel in Beijing after a short 100 RMB taxi ride.  However, once I got to the hotel I found out that Agoda.com who I booked the room through had asked that I fax them a copy of my passport and credit card as part of the fraud verification process.  Oh sure agoda.com let me grab the fax machine I keep with me and send it to you.  So I ended up paying over double what the quoted price was because supposedly it was the only room they had available.  It was 1AM and I was in no mood to go hotel shopping so I just checked in.  I had to give some help to my client so I was up till about 3AM working on that.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>I think the highlight of my trip to China was flipping an old Chinese trick they have pulled on me 1,000,000 times back on them.  Let me be incredibly stereotypical for a minute here just to make a point.  I apologize in advance for anyone offended by this.  In America, and abroad, Chinese people will understand you when it is convenient for them, and five seconds later they know no English if what you are saying is no longer to their benefit to understand.  Well I finally got to flip this trick around at the hotel I stayed at in Shanghai.  Checkout was at noon, which I had neglected to inquire about.  I went downstairs at 1PM to checkout only to be told that I would pay a half day extra charge for being late to checkout.  However, this was told to me in pretty broken English, so I just keep staring at them like I did not understand and repeating the price 190 (the original price the hotel should have cost, because I was not paying an extra 95 RMB for one hour late checkout).  Eventually the woman became very frustrated and went to talk to her boss at which time suddenly the extra charge had been removed.  I can’t tell you how good this feels.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>I was pretty fired up to get back to China and see what the two major cities held for me, but as usual my experience in China was a mixed bag.  No one in the airport I asked for help/directions from let me know that there was a maglev train that went 400km/hr and took 8 minutes to get to the city center from the airport.  Instead I got scammed into taking a taxi who told me it’d be about 100 RMB and that he’d take a credit card but ended up being 300 RMB.  I didn’t have any RMB so I had to go to a bank and change my Thai Baht for RMB the waiting for which was included in the fair.  Absolute horsesh*t.  Then he took me to the wrong hotel, the correct name, but a different address so I had to lose my deposit on the other hotel and just checked into the one he brought me to.  But such is life in China.  After that little fiasco everything in Shanghai was awesome.  Despite losing a night there due to my idiocy in missing my flight, I still had a decent amount of time to see the sights in Shanghai, which aren’t very numerous.  Shanghai is much more a proper city, unlike what I experienced in Guilin and Shenzen.
I spent my first day there learning the subways, cruising around by myself downtown.  The center of the city is pretty cool, with huge pedestrian streets almost twice as wide as any street in Manhattan.  Really cool shops and nice little cafes in addition to tons of pretty impressive skyscrapers.  Around 5PM I got some dinner and Herbert’s boyfriend Ben came to meet up with me at the café I was at.  We hopped the train to meet up with Billings near where he worked in Jing’an.  It was a cool little Belgian bar and he was with his business partner who had drinks with us as well.  After a few hours of drinks and some good times Ben and I headed to meet up with the Spanish couple I had met on my trek in Thailand.  We met them at a subway station that was near what I would call the Times Square of China.  Lots of big colorful lights and crazy displays.  Thank god I had met up with Ben earlier as it would have been impossible to locate them without his cell phone.  When we finally found them we headed to a cheap Chinese restaurant that was really good and really reasonably priced.  We had some spicy beef over rice along with Sake and some beers.  After that we headed to the local pub near where the Spanish couple lived for a last round of beers.  It was a really awesome way to end the night in Shanghai, so good to see those guys again.  Ben and I had planned on hitting a Chinese club afterwards but it was already one and he had to get to bed for work.
