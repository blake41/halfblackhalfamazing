  <div class="entry-content"><p>Stepping off the plane back in Hawaii almost 2 years to the day that I left felt like coming home.  A large part of that was probably just my joy at being back in America and out of the craziness of Asia.  So nice to be around native English speakers, and all the other little nuances that make being abroad so difficult just washed away and everything is simple and easy again.  Dennis picked me up at the airport and the first thing I did was get a Sausage Mcmuffin with egg, Cool Ranch Doritos and Red Gatorade.  I had been dying for the latter two while travelling and hadn’t been able to find either since I’d left the states.  I threw all my stuff down at Dennis’ place, where I’d be staying for the first few nights of my trip and did my laundry and took care of errands that’d been too difficult to take care of from abroad. <br/>
We left for Molokai the following evening around 9PM after a nice dinner out with Dennis and his wife.  One of Dennis’ friends Scott was joining us.  He’s in his 40’s and was an amazing addition to the crew.  He’s an alcoholic ex-pilot who is just hilarious.  He had great stories and is viscerally nervous at all times.  He worried constantly about all these things that I’d never think to worry about and Dennis wouldn’t ever answer him and would  just tell him to Shut the F*ck up about every 10 minutes.  The ride over to Molokai was perfect.  Just the right amount of wind and a surprisingly calm ride through the channel with maybe 5 foot swells.  We arrived at Molokai about 10AM after watching a gorgeous sunrise on the water.  We walked into town and had an amazing breakfast of French Toast on Sweet Bread.  After that we took naps and waited for Dennis’ friend to pick us up.  He had this baby blue old school Ford that must have been from 1960 it was so old but only had 70K miles on it.  He took us to his house which was really chill and right on the water.  It had an awesome screened in porch that looked out over the water and the sunset.  We kicked it with him for a while and then he let us take his car and drive around the island.  We went to see Kalapaupa where the leper colony used to be.  It’s a pretty spectacular view from the cliffs as I’d only seen it from the North side of Molokai from the boat on the way back from Maui a few years earlier.  The Molokai sea cliffs are the largest in the world and Kalapaupa is a peninsula that extends out from the cliffs.<br/>
Back in the day when leprosy ravaged Hawaii people were basically banished here so as to contain the spread of the disease.  It’s a perfect natural prison as you can’t climb 3000 foot cliffs and you’re on an island peninsula surrounded by water.  There’s no where to go.  Although leprosy is no longer contagious (antibiotics to kill the disease were developed in the 40’s) most people chose to remain on Kalapaupa even after they were allowed to leave as it had become their home more than the islands that had banished them.  So today, there’s still a small town on the peninsula where the remaining survivors live.  It’s a pretty fascinating story and I’ve read two books about it which I’d recommend to anyone interested in the story.
After checking out the peninsula and the “phallic rock” we headed back into town.  We made sandwiches and dinner on the boat and got to work on the handle of rum we had brought.  We met up with Dennis’ friend at hotel Halloween party around 9PM.  We spent a few hours kicking it and drinking at the hotel and then (probably stupidly) decided to sail to Maui that night.  Around midnight we pulled out of the harbor and sailed into the channel.  You can see the lights of Lahaina, Maui from Molokai so steering is not a problem at night and the wind bent just the way it needed to so we didn’t have to tack at all on the way to Lahaina.  I had the tiller for the whole 6 hour sail from Molokai to Maui and it was both exhausting and exhilarating.  Dennis caught up on some much needed sleep and Scott stayed on deck with me before falling asleep a few hours into the sail.  At sunrise as we were approaching Maui I woke Dennis up, hit the sack, and let him drive us into the Lahaina harbor.  There were no slips available so we anchored at one of the Yacht club’s mooring balls and took the dinghy in.  We ate breakfast and then mostly slept the day away and prepared for the big Halloween party that night.  We got a recommendation from a bartender to buy grass skirts at longs as it was a cheap easy costume.  We picked up the costumes and then headed back to the boat to pregame.  Around 9PM when we were sufficiently drunk we headed to the streets.  The main drag of Lahaina is just one main road and there were people all dressed up just walking up and down the streets.  I’ve done a few Halloweens on Oahu and it’s always a crazy affair and I had been promised a Mardi Gras type party on Maui that made Oahu seem like kids stuff.  Unfortunately we found out that things had started getting so out of hand two years ago that the police had basically shut down the party.  There weren’t that many people on the streets and the first bar we went into was pretty much empty.  We decided to head to Moose Mcgilcutty’s as that was the only place we were sure there’d at least be some party.  Moose’s had a long line but once we got in there weren’t many people there.  There talent in the bar was particularly lacking so Scott and I just pounded double gin and tonics and got out on the dance floor and had a ball.  Dennis met some couple on their honeymoon who liked listening to him talk so he was enthralled and headed back to the boat with them.  I think Scott and I left when the bar closed and headed back to the boat.  It was a great night despite it being less crazy than I had expected.
The next morning we had breakfast and headed out early to get back to Oahu.  I did about 6 of the 10-12 hour sail back to Oahu and it was again just about perfect.  It was a beautiful day, small swell, and perfect wind.  We rolled into Oahu around 9PM exhausted and immediately hit the hay when we got back to the Condo.

  <div class="entry-content"><p>Sunday November 8th,</p>

<p>Haubush, Ewa Beach Oahu</p>

<p>Rolling into the dirt parking lot Sunday morning the surf looked marginal at first glance.  As is usually the case, it looks better once you paddle out, and Haubush was looking as good as it gets.  Blake and I posted up just left of the main peak which was pretty crowded by local standards.  We sat on a peak that we pretty much had to ourselves with the exception of two stand up paddle board guys.  Lined up head high sets were rolling through and we got plenty of them&#8230; splitting peaks left and right (I&#8217;m regular foot and Blake is goofy).  I won&#8217;t bore you with the detailed wave by wave recap but just know little Blakey was killing it.  I joked that when we went in people on the beach would be high fiving us and sure enough a guy approached us asking about our boards and where he could get one.</p>

<p>Blake&#8217;s note, joe is a man who embraces brevity.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>First off, I didn’t spend nearly enough time in Japan.  What a cool place.  I wish I had at least a month.  Also if you go, get the rail pass, it’s less than the price of a one way ticket to any major part of Japan but can only be purchased outside of Japan.  So it’s worth buying if you plan on taking even one bullet train ride as it allows you to ride unlimited for 7 days and if you use it even once you’ve already saved money.  I really wanted to go visit a friend of a friend in Kyoto but it was $260 USD for a round trip ticket which seemed crazy for just one day.<br/>
One weird thing about Japan is that tons of people walk around with those Doctors masks on.  I know that SARS must have been a big scare for people over there but really it was years ago, what kind of way is it to go through life wearing a mask constantly.  It’s just ridiculous.  Why not lock yourself up in a giant bubble so no germs can come near you. Also I liked how the Japanese subway stops are numbered.  So you can look at the map once and know ok I’m at stop 3, and going to 9 so you always know how many stops away you are and whether your going in the right direction or if you’ve missed your stop.
I really want to get back to Japan and spend more time outside of Tokyo, and more time enjoying the nightlife.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>After Nikko and the long train ride I decided to go out to see the red light district of Shinjuku, but by the time I was ready to go it had started raining again pretty steadily and I didn’t want to be wandering around the city late at night all wet or miss the last train back and get stuck out all night in the wet and cold.  So I ended up just drinking beers and whiskey alone in my room and chatting on gchat.  The next morning was my last day in Tokyo so I wanted to see Shinjuku which was kind of like the midtown/times square of Tokyo.  I caught an early train that way knowing that I had to catch a 8PM flight.  Shinjuku was cool, very New York Midtown feel but a little bit nicer.  I spent the day just walking around, checking out stores and checking out the architecture.  I found an electonics store that was massive and had a different type of gadget on each floor.  If you know me you know this is pretty much my version of heaven.  They had the most amazing little computers and I was so jealous at the wireless cards speed you could get for these tiny little netbook like devices.  I checked my watch and realized I was running a bit late so ran back to the subway and headed back to the hostel to check out.  On the train I realized the plane was at 7:30 not 8 and I had already left Shinjuku an hour later than I had planned so I panicked and thought I was in danger of missing the plane.  I ran back to the hostel, grabbed my stuff, checked out, and ran back to the subway to head to the airport train.  Luckily I pulled into the airport with about 1:15 till takeoff.  However at the information booth I found out I was at the wrong terminal, so I sprinted to a cab and rode about 5 minutes to the other terminal.  Luckily when I got to the counter they told me to relax and take a deep breath as I had made the plane.  Finally some good plane luck.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>I finally got out of Tokyo and decided to do a day trip to Nikko.  The train ride was long, but the seats were comfortable and I was stoked to finally be exploring Japan a little bit.  After a 1.5-2HR ride I arrived at the town center.  I grabbed some food and bought a bus pass that takes you to all the historical sights.  Once you head up into the mountains on the bus you immediately see what all the fuss is about.  Nikko looks like you expect Japan to look like.  Particularly in the fall the trees are turning the most beautiful red’s and oranges and the whole forest looks like it’s on fire.  Interspersed between the trees in the forest are these really cool Monasteries and Temples.  You feel like you’ve stumbled onto an ancient Samurai camp.  Unfortunately all the tours and information are in Japanese so I learned very little about what any of the temples and/or statues actually represented or were used for back in the day.  Despite that, just spending the day wandering through the forests and checking out the temples was sick.  Around 4PM I decided to head further up the mountain so I could check out the onsen (Japanese Baths).  This was another awesome experience.  The lady at the bus stop recommended a hotel on this lake in the mountains.  As I arrived the sun was setting over the mountains and water and the air was crisp and cool.  They give you slippers and a towel and you go into a sort of rustic all wooden building where there’s a changing room and then a 10 by 20 3 foot deep pool.  The whole place reeks of sulfur as I imagine that’s what is causing the natural heating of the water.  You acclimate to the sulfur pretty quickly although I think I breathed through my mouth the whole time.  You shower and wash yourself before you go into the bath and then get into the pool.  I have to say it was kinda weird to be kicking it naked in a shallow pool with like 10 old Japanese dudes, but it was also really cool.  It felt like stepping into a time warp to another world.  The water is so hot and relaxing and you can sort of feel all the minerals seeping into your body and making you healthier (probably totally placebo effect).  The back wall of the onsen was all glass and I sat in the natural hot springs and watched the sun set over the lake.  It was about as relaxing and cool of an experience as I’ve had on the trip.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>After such a long night out I basically burned a whole day resting.  The day after that unfortunately was pouring rain so I wasn&#8217;t sure what I was going to get to do.  After talking to some people at breakfast, they suggested I do the Roppongi Hills museum tour.  I checked out the Suntory Art Museum which was actually quite beautiful given that I hate art.  They had an exhibit on Japanese paper.  This included everything from just straight up different types of paper made in the traditional Japanese way, to incredible Oragami type foldings and creations of flowers and really large displays all made of paper.  It was actually really impressive.  After that I headed to the Fuji photo center where they had pretty awesome landscape pictures of all of the most beautiful cities in the world.  I finished up my tour with a visit to the Mori Art Museum which was awesome.  The museum had an exhibition by Ai WeiWei who is a famous Chinese modern artist who got popular during a ten year stint in NYC during the late 80&#8217;s and early 90&#8217;s.  His exhibit was actually pretty cool.  He seemed to have this fusion between Western and Eastern art and minimalist combined with contemporary.  The highlight of the visit was actually a movie by another Japanese film artist whose name I neglected to write down.  This sick movie must have come straight out of either Bryan Thomas or Julian Kelly&#8217;s mind.  The filmmaker put an ad out in a dutch newspaper looking for someone who could tell a really sad personal story on film.  He gets the guy in this tiny little room that&#8217;s decorated kind of like a spaceship.  The guy starts telling his story which basically consists of meeting the girl of his dreams, getting her pregnant, marrying her, his wife leaving him because of his drinking, and him losing access to his daughter which was emotionally crushing.  The whole time this guy is telling the story he is on the verge of tears.  The filmmaker is dressed like some kind of martian with silver paint all over his face and this bizzare costume.  Every time the guy would get about into the story the filmmaker would interrupt and ask the guy to change his pose, or put something else on to the point of utter ridiculousness.  Check out the pics at the end of the post to see the progression.  Honestly it&#8217;s something you have to see to believe, i was in tears laughing at this movie.  The poor guy is like pouring his heart out and the filmmaker has him shirtless with like a french bread roll in his mouth by the end.  The climax of the film is the filmmaker sticking his head through a hole in the wall and squealing like a pig while the guy is trying to talk.  It&#8217;s honestly enough to make you fall of your seat laughing because it&#8217;s just so f*cked up. [gallery]</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>After the money debacle, I told myself I was hitting the town hard.  It was a Saturday night, and I wanted to see what Tokyo had to offer in the partying department. I treated myself to my favorite restaurant, Gyu Kaku, then bought a tall boy, and two fifths of Whiskey.  I sat in my room alone and pregamed.  The front desk guy at the hostel had suggested I got to Roppingo, and to take the last train which was 12:30.  At around midnight I headed over to the subway station only to find the last train was 11:56!  Come on.  So I hopped in a cab and paid the 60,000 Yen it cost to get to Roppingo.  A total ripoff given that the train costs 2,000 Yen, but I wasn&#8217;t going to waste my only opportunity to go out in Tokyo to save 60 bucks.  When I arrived in Roppingo I knew I was going to have a great time.  I saw three people walking and asked them if I could join them wherever they were going.  The dude who was kind of the leader of the group was from Alabama but had been teaching English in Japan for 8 years.  Cool dude.  He&#8217;d just come from a bachelor party where everyone had gone to bed already&#8230;seriously?  There was a hot asian girl from Cali who did Educational research, and an asian dude I did not get to meet.  They had all just sort of met up at the bachelor party but didn&#8217;t know each other prior to that.  We went to some club, I didn&#8217;t even see the name, and it had a 4,000 yen cover and came with two free drinks.  Crazy expensive in my mind, but drinks were about 1,000 Yen so really you were paying 2,000 Yen cover with a 2 drink minimum, not terrible.  The club was awesome and I bought the dude from Alabama, Adam, a beer for letting me join their crew.  I kicked it with the girl from Cali for a while, but I don&#8217;t remember her name.  The rest of the night is kind of a blur.  I was there until 5AM but couldn&#8217;t tell you what I did for most of the time there.  At some point around 5AM I woke up in a chair by the pool table by myself.  I walked outside the club and ran into two dudes who were going to get food so I hopped in a cab with them.  One of the dudes was from Texas and was honestly the biggest donkey I have ever met.  Can we just nuke that state already?  Or at least revoke their right to have a passport and travel?  It&#8217;s embarrassing.  The other kid was from Portugal and was really chill.  They were both studying abroad in South Korea and were in Tokyo for the weekend.  The dude from Portugal was trying to explain to the Texas dude to be more careful when they are out because he had gotten agressive with two Yakuza and one Sicilian guy who could have had him killed in like 5 seconds.  This kid was like I&#8217;m not scared of them blah blah blah such a retard I considered killing myself at least 5 times during the cab ride.  He also kept rubbing the cab drivers head who was this nice old Japanese guy, so disrespectful.  They wanted to go to the fish market, which is closed on Sundays, so we drove around for a while with the cabbie trying to explain that to the kid from Texas who kept insisting that he was taking us to the wrong place.  He took us to the fish market, but it was just closed.  At that point I was like I&#8217;m out guys, you enjoy.  And I saw a McDonalds that opened at 6AM which was in 15 minutes.  I sat down, enjoyed about 15 minutes of episode 3 of true blood, and then had the best two sausage mcmuffins with egg i&#8217;ve ever eaten.  Then I hopped on the train and crashed hard when I got back to my hotel.</p>

<p>For some reason I only took one picture.  Very sad story and uncharacteristic of me.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>This day may have been the most difficult day I&#8217;ve faced so far on the trip.  If you&#8217;ve been reading this blog then you know that I lost my wallet in Bali.  I haven&#8217;t had an ATM card since then, just a credit card, and have had my roommates send me cash periodically.  When I was in China I noticed I was running low so I asked Russ to send me some cash.  I didn&#8217;t have time to pick it up in China, so I figured I&#8217;d just grab it when I got to Tokyo.  My hostel required up front payment for the 5 nights I was staying, so I had to give up about 13,000 Yen of my remaining 15,000 Yen.  Then after food on Friday night and Saturday morning I had about 1,000 Yen left.  I headed into the city to go to the bank where I could pick up the moneygram transfer.  When I got to the bank, it was around 2PM and I was told that because China was specified as the country where I could pick up the money, I could not pick it up in Japan.  I didn&#8217;t know it was country specific and begged the bank and then the moneygram people to give me the money, but apparently there was nothing that could be done.  Then I noticed my 1,000 Yen note had fallen out of my wallet, which meant I only had the coins in my pocket, which was about 50 Yen.  Its 190 Yen for a subway ticket.  The bank guy suggested getting a cash advance.  I walked to the subway to find a public phone, but couldn&#8217;t figure out how to use the Japanese public phones.  I walked back to the bank and asked if they&#8217;d let me use one of the bank&#8217;s phone to call my credit card company to see how to get a cash advance.  The manager took pity on me and let me use his.  My citibank said I could go to any bank with my ID and CC and get an advance.  Phew.  However the bank manager told me that no banks were open, and wouldn&#8217;t reopen till Monday.  So I had to borrow the phone again to see if there was an immediate way to set up a pin number.  There was, but I needed my checking account number for verification.  I had my checking account number, but it was back in my bag at the hostel.  Awesome.  So I had to get back to my hotel with only 50 Yen.  So I resolved to go beg for money in the subway.  Once I got in the subway I saw a Starbucks and figured if I could use their wireless I must have my account number somewhere online.  However, due to the language barrier they couldn&#8217;t figure out how to get me on their wireless.  So I was back to the begging plan, but at least I had a mango latte on hand.  I figured I&#8217;d wait for the first Westerner I saw, plead my case, and since I clearly wasn&#8217;t a bum begging for money, I was well dressed, clean shaven, had an American passport etc etc, I figured it&#8217;d be pretty easy.  I&#8217;m happy to report that the first person I asked gave me the money, and was really cool about it and was like hey I&#8217;ve been there before, don&#8217;t worry about it at all.  When I went to the ticket machine though, I realize I had done some math wrong, and was still 10 Yen short, so I turned to the Japanese girl next to me hoping she spoke English and asked for 10 Yen.  That&#8217;s like 1 cent so she was more than happy to help me out.  I finally got on the subway and made it back to the hostel.  I called citibank and got the pin number set up.  I went to 7-11 and used the ATM to get a cash advance, but it didn&#8217;t work!  Then I really started to freak out.  I went back to my hotel, called citibank and they told me there was a fraud alert on my card because someone tried to get a cash advance with my card in Japan.  That person was me I told them!  Oh ok all good now then!  Thanks citi!  I went back to 7-11 and finally got my hands on some cash.  Never felt so relieved to put bills in my wallet.[gallery]</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>Whenever I am with friends I feel like we celebrate and I am always in search of good toasts to say.  When I was in Hawaii they taught me “Okole Maluna” which literally means assholes up, but should translate as like Bottoms up.  As I travel I have been asking everyone to tell me how they say Cheers in their language.  So here you go</p>

<p>Austria: Proust! Pronounced like Proost
Holland: Proost!
Australia: Cheers Mate! The mate part is the key part here
Sweeden: Skoul! Pronounced like the Danish one but slightly different but I couldn’t hear the difference because they have vowels that we don’t.
Denmark: Skul! Pronounced like Skull
China: Gan Bei! Pronounced like G(a as in apple)n Bay</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>Windows update automatically updated my computer and did a restart which meant that alarmclock.com was no longer on, so my alarm never went off.  Luckily, I woke up at 6:30 AM.  How my body knew to only sleep for 3.5 hours when it was totally wasted from the day before is beyond me.  I grabbed my stuff, checked out as quickly as possible and hopped in a cab to the airport and told the driver to step on it.  This time when I got to the airport, rather than patiently waiting, I ran to the front of a line and asked if I could still get on my flight.  Luckily the taxi ride to the airport was only about 30 minutes instead of the hour I had been told.  So I made my flight with about 15 minutes to spare.  So lucky.  I think if I had missed that flight, I would have just had to give up on this whole trip and go home.  I really think it would have broken my spirit.  The highlight of the day was an incredible sunrise where the sun just appeared as a golden ball on the horizon.  Don&#8217;t think I&#8217;ve ever really seen the sun rise like that, must be the smog or something.<a href="http://halfblackhalfamazing.wordpress.com/2009/11/01/tokyooooooooooo/img_0585-2/"><img src="http://halfblackhalfamazing.files.wordpress.com/2009/10/img_05851.jpg" alt="IMG_0585" /></a></p>

<p>I checked into a hostel as Tokyo is crazy expensive for hotels and I figured it&#8217;d make it easier to meet people.  Although update:everyone at this hostel is really unfriendly.  I have not met one person yet.  Anyways, I was so exhausted that I just grabbed a bite to eat and hit the sack despite really wanting to go out on a Friday night in Tokyo.[gallery]</p>
