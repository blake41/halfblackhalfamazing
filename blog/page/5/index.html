  <div class="entry-content"><p>For me the last few days in Floripa went out without a bang.  The rest of the crew went out to Pacha on Saturday night for the biggest night of the week but I didn’t have the funds to join.  Pacha is well known for being the club of clubs down here and is not cheap.  The guys got VIP bottle service for about 300 Reias per person and said the club had about 3,000 people in it and truly blew away all expectations.  Supposedly the girls there were even more ridiculous than the ones we saw at the other clubs and daily at the beach.  One of the guys brought home a pretty hot Brasileira around 7AM when everyone got home and whose dad came to pick her up the next day when we all got up…
Other highlights included going to Praia Joaquina to do sandboarding which was cool to do once but not nearly as cool as I think it could have been.  The boards look like snowboards but don’t edge like snowboards do on snow or wakeboards on water.  Unfortunately you basically can’t turn at all because the rails just sort of catch the sand and dump you on your face.  Despite that, it was fun to mess around a bit although after a few runs you are dripping with sweat and utterly exhausted from the walk back up the dunes.  I imagine sandboarding in a desert in huge dunes where you can just bomb straight down would be cooler, or if you had boards with a design that looked more like a surfboard the experience would be much better.  Also, Grant and Jeb made an awesome Thanksgiving dinner which was nice because spending thanksgiving alone would have been tough.  We grilled up a bunch of sausage and beef with grilled onions on big skewers in a sweet hearth oven we had in the house and had a bunch of beers.  Other than that the week was all about relaxing at the beach, reading, and staring at nearly naked girls.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>Floripa days mainly consist of going to Praia Mole, drinking beers on the beach and/or eating at the little beach bars there.  It’s a pretty amazing upgrade from America to be able to sip Caipirinha’s and/or your drink of choice while you’re on the beach.  Why we can’t do this (legally) in America is beyond me.  When I first got to Floripa the waves were probably 9 foot sets but since it was a beach break the wave seemed to just close out on all the set waves.  I talked to an Australian kid who had been there a while and surfed it quite a bit said when the swell came in from the right direction it broke really nice but I was there for a week and never saw it breaking well once.  I tried paddling out the first day I was there but was using a board someone at the hostel loaned me that was waaay to small and had no wax on it so after paddling out I realized I was going to get worked and paddled right back in.  Yes I am a p*ssy.</p>

<p>The second night we were there I wanted to take a night off and the guys wanted to check out Jurere which is the super rich Northern part of the island where all the celebrities live in mansions and what not.  I got the feeling that since we were in the Hamptons in the winter that the place would be deserted, but they insisted on going.  As predicted, they spent an hour driving up and another hour driving back after realizing it was utterly deserted.  Since it was Hip Hop night Greg and Jeb made a late night foray into El Divino after returning from the North, and the rest of the guys went for another sunrise on the beach.  The next night we all went to Latitude which is a bar/club closer to Praia Mole where we were staying.  It was relatively deserted but we were wasted and met a couple girls who came back to the house late night for a wild late night dance party.  The guys from Houston had brought a strobe light which just seemed to turn the party up a couple notches not to mention us playing rap music at full volume on the stereo at 5AM.  A few times during the night the neighbors had the complex manager shut off all the power to the neighborhood.  At the time we assumed it was the circuit breaker and only later found out from the realtor what had actually happened.  After a long night we all hit up the beach for the sunrise again.  I woke up the next day realizing that I had gotten the bartenders number but she spoke only Portuguese and I at the time only knew how to say “Obrigado (thank you)” in Portuguese&#8230;

  <div class="entry-content"><p>The next day around 6 Jeb (my old boss at Proto) and his brother picked me up from my hostel and we headed over to the house.  The house was awesome, literally right across from Praia Mole which is “the” beach in Floripa, but everything was just slightly sub par.  We had an outdoor pool that was probably 6 feet long by 2 feet wide and 6 feet deep and was made of blue plastic.  We had a wooden above ground hot tub which had a sort of greenish color from algae growing in it, and a pretty baller steam room.  The house itself was more legit with the back being all glass panes so you could see the gorgeous backyard.  There was a big wooden thing set up with three really comfortable hammocks.  There were two big screen plasma’s and a killer home entertainment system.  And luckily there were beds enough for the eight of us staying there.  The 8 guys consisted of Jeb, myself, his brother Nick, and a mix of Nick’s high school and college friends.  Grant and Greg were New Yorkers and there were 3 guys from Houston, Matt, Alejandro and Hugh.  Everyone was in Brazil one week vacation party mode and I struggled to keep up.  We bought a bunch of beers (they mainly drink Brahma, Bohemia, Skol and Antartica down here) and got the party started.  I had heard from the hostel crew that El Divinio in El Centro (the center of town) would be the place to go.  So we drove into town and got dinner at a pizza place.  After dinner and some drinks we headed over to El Divino.  The place is separated into a pretty cool lounge area and one giant room where the club is.  The dance floor club area was pretty amazing.  The whole outer area is kind of raised like you’re in a stadium which is all “VIP” which just means you are getting bottle service.  At one end of the room there is a raised balcony where the stage is and where the band plays, and there are various bars around the outskirts of the club. The girls at El Divino are just utterly absurd.  If you were a model scout, you could walk into the club, grab the first 10 girls you see, and you’d have the new Victorias Secret angels.  The first part of the night was kinda boring because the band was terrible (at least to my American ears) and were playing weird kinda Samba music that nobody seemed to really be able to dance to.  After the band ended they started playing the type of techno/house music you’d typically hear at a club and it ended up being really fun.  Me and ‘Dro ran into some of the girls I had met at the hostel and we danced with them all night and had a blast.  Around 4 we all called it a night and headed home.  I was pretty beat and went right to bed but the rest of the guys stayed up all night and went to the beach to catch the sunrise.

  <div class="entry-content"><p>Florianopolis is the Hamptons of Brazil.  It&#8217;s an island just off the South coast of Brazil connected to the mainland by a big iconic bridge.  I left Rio in the middle of the day with the goal of reaching Sao Paulo by 8PM so I would have time to get to a hostel for the night, or crash with Abreu before continuing on my journey to Floripa the next day.  Unfortunately my bus got in a little late and I had forgotten to book a hostel.  I was worried about searching the mean streets of SP for a hostel so late at night so I just hopped on an overnight bus to Floripa.  This way I&#8217;d get to Floripa a day early and have time to meet some people and get the lay of the land before the rest of the crew arrived.  Bus travel, via the 1001 bus company, is the most comfortable way I&#8217;ve ever traveled with maybe only the exception of the sleeper train in Thailand.  The most fun way I&#8217;ve traveled was the sleeper boat in Thailand, although way less comfortable.  I arrived in Floripa and met an English girl named Max who had a hostel she was headed to so I joined her on the bus.  We made it to the hostel in Barra Lagoa which is on the southeast side of the big lagoon in the middle of the island. Met some cool people at the hostel.  One kid from NYC who lives in the EV and works for JPMorgan.  He had done the southeast asia trip just like me and was hooking up with a Sweedish girl he was traveling with.  One night on an island in Vietnam his whole crew that he&#8217;d been rolling with got wasted and one of the kids with them had his marriage license and they got married.  Totally trumped all my stories from SEA. The hostel was called Tucano hostel and was one of the best I&#8217;ve stayed at.  The kids that ran it were really cool and friendly and every night would make dinner for everyone, and run a bar on the premises making caparinhas and then organize a big van to take people to whatever the hot spot of the night was.  Dinner was an awesome Thai dish and I got drunk with a bunch of Aussies, Europeans and some South American girls.  We all headed to a bar off Praia Joaquina for Samba night.  I had mixed feelings about the night.  Per usual, the talent was top notch, but I didn&#8217;t know the dance steps that all the Brazillians new.  It was really hard and fast and I&#8217;ve never seen such impressive dancing.  One of the Brazillian girls staying at our hostel tried to teach me and I got it OK but not well enough to lead any other girls.  Had a great time dancing and partying all night with the kids from the hostel though and running around the massive sand dunes on the beach by myself and chilling under the stars.  All in all a great night despite the frustration of not being able to dance with any chicks, and not being able to talk to any girls because no one speaks English.  Really need to step up the efforts to learn Portugese.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>The last night in Rio was pretty quiet.  I checked into the Cabana Copa hostel in Copacabana intending not to go out.  However I sat at the bar for a bit because I had fallen in love with the bartender.  The sweetest sexiest Brazillian girl with an amazing accent was making caipirinha&#8217;s and i couldn&#8217;t say no.  Met a Sweedish guy, an American couple from LA, a British girl and a few others I can&#8217;t remember.  We went to a local pizzeria and then headed to a local Samba bar called Bip Bip.  It was supposed to be a super chill local bar, but we got there at 11pm right after the band had left.  It was still a pretty cool scene, kind of French cafe style spilling out onto the street.  People outside drinking beers and having a good time and chilling.  The guy who ran the bar clearly used to be a baller in the music world because there&#8217;s pics of him all over the inside of the bar with all these badass musicians.  Was disappointed I missed the music but it&#8217;s on my list for when I get back to Rio.  We stopped for some late night Acai and then headed to bed around 2AM.  [gallery]</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>Rio is definitely one of the most amazing cities on the planet.  For sure my favorite with Hong Kong and New York a close second and third.  The energy in the city is incomparable to anywhere else.  The geography is unlike anything I&#8217;ve ever seen, a city built in and around mountains and more coastline squeezed into a small area than you can imagine.  It basically has tons of long arms like an octopus that jut out and create more beaches and coastline everywhere.  On top of that add the worlds most beautiful women who wear thongs to the beach and are as close to naked as can be,  a culture that celebrates music, rythm, dancing and partying and you have a city teeming with life and positive energy.  They estimate that on weekends there are 400,000 people on the beaches, and if you go to the beach you can barely move they are so packed.</p>

<p>The first night, we went to Porcao for dinner which was supposed to be the best Churrascaria in Rio and it lived up to it&#8217;s name.  The meat was incredible and we ate and drank for hours.  After that the first night going out partying started off really slow.  Since we were staying in Leblon, which is a really upscale neighborhood, there were few bars/clubs going on, but we couldn&#8217;t find anywhere better to go.  Finally someone clued us in to going to LAPA.  Usually the party in LAPA only goes off on Friday nights, but since it was Black Awareness day that Friday (a new Brazillian holiday) the party was going on Thursday and Friday night.  So we hopped in a cab and headed to LAPA.  The minute we got close I knew we had found what we were looking for.  LAPA has these big white arches and everything in the vicinity is just people dancing in the streets.  Street musicians banging on drums and everyone singing and dancing.  All along the main road there is just club/bar after club/bar with live music of all flavors.  After partying in the street for a while we picked a bar and started dancing.  We had an awesome time at the bar dancing to the live music all night.  At the end of the night we ran into the worst Brazillian custom I&#8217;ve seen here.  When you enter any club/bar they give you a card which you are supposed to hold onto all night.  The bartender will write on your card what drinks you get, so basically you are in charge of not losing your own tab.  If you don&#8217;t have your tab at the end of the night you are fucked.  Luckily I had all the tabs but Sivan&#8217;s and had not lost them so me Jenny and Maya were cool, but Sivan had lost hers and they someone had found it and put a bunch of drinks on it so she got f*cked.  At that point we didn&#8217;t care though and just wanted to go home.  We finally caught a cab and headed home.  We did a little late night skinnydipping and called it a night.</p>

<p>The next day we got a slow start but finally woke up, got food, and headed to Leblon beach which was about a block away from our hotel.  The beach scene was phenomenal, and we got an umbrella and chairs like everyone does here and just kicked it all day at the beach. The water was just cold enough to be refreshing and but warm enough to feel great. After the beach we caught a cab to the sugarloaf mountain and rode the cable car up to the top.  The view of the city at night was just breathtakingly beautiful.  It sounds cliche but Rio really is spectacularly beautiful both at night and during the day.  We headed back to the hotel, bought some quick food and drinks and pregamed in our hotel room.  After dinner we knew we wanted to go straight to LAPA for the Friday night party so we caught a cab that way.  The Friday night party in LAPA was even more insane than it had been the previous night. There was probably 50% more people in the streets.  We went into this African club which had this insanely cool drum/dancing performance.  Maybe 30 different kinds of drums and 10 women on stage doing such cool dances with crazy outfits on.  This is what I pictured Carnival being like.  After the performance we went back to the streets and ate street food, danced and drank all night in the streets.  After a long evening of partying we headed back to the hotel and went to bed.</p>

<p>The next day was Sivan and Maya&#8217;s last so we walked around Ipanema beach and did some exploring and shopping and what not.  At the end of the day we sent them off back to NYC and Jenny and I got some dinner at a pizza place near our new hotel in Ipanema and then took a cab towards Barra to check out Ilha dos Pescadores (Island of the fishes).  It was a cool spot but was empty when we got there around 9.  We talked to some people and they said to come back at midnight.  It was an interesting scene as the club was on a bridge kind of in the middle of a waterway, and there were a bunch of canals that headed out into the distance with houses on either sides of the canal.  We saw a small water taxi coming back towards shore.  We talked to a guy who spoke a bit of english and he suggested going to Sevino until the club opened.  We took the taxi through the canals to Sevino which was a bar right on the water.  We were pretty curious about the canals and the houses so we walked around the small alleyways for a bit trying to figure out what this community was.  Then we hit up Sevino for some drinks which was really chill.  We caught the taxi back to Isha dos Pescadores which had a big line out front but no music.  We waited about 15 minutes to see if there was live music but didn&#8217;t see anything going on.  We were both exhausted and wanted to get up early to go sightseeing the next day so we bailed and headed home.</p>

<p>The next day we did a favela (slum) tour.  It sounded weird that they&#8217;d have tours that go through the slums because to me it sounded like you were treating the poor like zoo attractions.  However, people had said we HAD to do it so why not.  Once you do it you realize that it&#8217;s in conjunction with the community as it&#8217;s a non profit organization that takes the money from the tours and runs schools and social programs in the favela so we were welcome there.  You also learn that the favelas are really safer than most of rio as the drug lords that run each slum forbid all crime as this brings the police into the favela which hurts business.  I felt remarkably safe and the favela itself was actually much nicer than I had envisioned.  City of God made Rio look soooo poor but in reality the favelas were not nearly as bad.  Half of them have sewage treatment and running water.  Not to say I&#8217;d like to live there, but it&#8217;s nothing like how poor people live in say poor parts of Southeast Asia.  The tour was really well done and informative because our guide was really well educated, had a law degree and used to live in Holland.  I&#8217;d recommend anyone who goes to Rio to do one.  After the tour we caught a train to the Christ statue which was incredible.  I feel like there are a lot of tourist attractions you go check out that don&#8217;t live up to the hype.  The Christ statue really does look like God is overlooking and protecting the city from on top of a ridiculous mountain.  The view from up top is awesome, even better than Sugarloaf Mountain and you really get a good sense of what the cities geography is.  After the christ statue I sent Jenny off and headed to a hostel for my last night.[gallery]</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>I left Hawaii around noon and headed to LA.  I got into LA late and stayed with my buddy Josh (who I met in Hawaii).  Luckily he lived in downtown LA so he was right near union station where the bus let me off.  He lives in a big loft building which is actually pretty cool in the artists district.  He lives with a bunch of other Scientology kids (long story).  It was awesome to see him again.  We went out the minute I got there as they had been waiting for me and headed to a bar that was supposed to be the kind of post dodgeball bar.  Apparently in LA there is a dodgeball scene that is similar to the williamsburg kickball scene.  Although when we got to the bar the scene was significantly weaker than what I&#8217;m used to post game in Brooklyn.  So after a bit we left looking for more of a party and did some bar hopping but never really came upon much.  Despite that, it was awesome to see Josh again, and get the updates on how his life is going and let him know what I&#8217;ve been up to etc etc.  We also crushed some late night Jack in the Box which really hit the spot.  One of Josh&#8217;s boys was nice enough to give me a lift to the airport in the morning and I there I headed to Mexico city.  I got to Mexico city in the late afternoon and had about a 6 hour layover before my redeye to Sao Paulo.  I kicked it in the Chili&#8217;s in the airport because they had wireless and then caught my plane to SP.  I had planned on catching a bus to Rio because I heard the scenery was awesome, but Abreu informed me that the bus station in Rio was in a real sinister part of town and showing up there with all my bags looking like a tourist could be real sketchy so I decided to catch a plane instead.  I got to Rio about two hours after arriving in SP to find out that the girls I was supposed to meet there had missed their flight out of Buenos Aires because they had gotten wasted the night before and slept through their alarm.  It was one of the more amusing emails I&#8217;ve ever gotten. So I caught the bus towards Leblon, where our hotel was, which is just west of Ipanema and Copacabana beaches.  The bus ride was a nightmare as it took about 3 hours to travel 30 km due to rush hour traffic.  When I got there I was so worn out from 48 hours of traveling that I figured it&#8217;d be more worthwhile to capitalize on the extra time solo and get some work done rather than going to party by myself.  Jenny was supposed to arrive around 11am the next day so I figured i&#8217;d stay up late and she&#8217;d arrive around when I woke up.  Somehow there was a front desk mix up and they had put me in a different room than the girl were staying in so even though she got in at 1 I didn&#8217;t find her till like 4.  It was great to see her again though and we went for a walk to go explore the coastline and get some food.  The girls didn&#8217;t get in until around 9 due to the same crazy traffic but when they got there they were ready to party&#8230;</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>Overall the trip to Hawaii was amazing.  After the insane last 3 weeks prior to reaching Hawaii, I really needed to relax, decompress, and recover from the grueling travel schedule I had put myself through.  By the time I had hit Tokyo, my social battery had been emptied, I barely talked to anyone in Tokyo.  I didn&#8217;t introduce myself to a single person in my hostel, I just didn&#8217;t want to talk to any more new people.  Staying in a nice house, with my own room/bed was just what I was looking for.  Seeing Joe again, getting to surf, meeting his wife was awesome.  Joe and Naoko both love to cook so we had gourmet meals pretty much every night.  All sorts of great grilled meat and fish and crazy sauces and stuff.  During the days we would get an early surf in at Haubush, the surf spot like 5 minutes from Joe&#8217;s place, and then Joe and I would work from home for the day.</p>

<p>It was also great to finally see all my old friends from Hawaii after two years away.  I got the Hawaiian Telcom crew together at Mai Tai&#8217;s, my favorite bar in the world, and saw my bartender friend Ed who is still there.  Got to see Ashley my old roomate, and Lisa my old pseudo girlfriend, Jack a guy I used to work/sail with.  The nights at Mai Tai&#8217;s were great, and I got as many of them in as possible while I was there.</p>

<p>We also had a great beach bbq at Ala Moana beach park with a bunch of Joe&#8217;s old employees and their friends who we used to surf with.  One of Naoko&#8217;s Japanese friends from SF, Satchko, stayed with us for like 3 or 4 days and she was a welcome addition as well.  She was really cool and liked to drink as much as the other three of us so it made for some long booze filled dinners at the house.  The only regrets of the trip were that we didn&#8217;t make it to North Shore to surf despite some great wave days, and didn&#8217;t end up going camping.  Other than that, some of the best weeks of the whole trip.   [gallery]</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>In celebration of my blog getting it&#8217;s four thousandth hit since inception, I&#8217;d like to share some of the stats with you as it&#8217;s told me a lot about my readers and what they find interesting.</p>

<p>I&#8217;ve written 96 posts since I left on August 13th.</p>

<p>The blogs busiest day was the day the post went up about randomly running into Webb in Laos.  The blog got 329 hits that day.</p>

<p>The top pictures are ones of me with girls, me out partying, and me with Webb.  So basically my audience is the same one that reads People magazine and Gawker.</p>
