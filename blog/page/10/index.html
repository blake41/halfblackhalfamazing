  <div class="entry-content"><p>Hello Blog readers, I apologize for not updating.  The past week+ has been pretty insane, and I&#8217;ve had little time to myself and even less internet access.  Here are the updates.</p>

<p>Arrived in Chiang Mai at around 9:30AM after a long train ride. I missed my trek so I scheduled it for the next morning.  I signed up for something called Flight of the Gibbon which is basically a giant zip line course set up in the canopy in the mountains where the Gibbons live.  I was going to do something called the Gibbon experience which Adam had recommended as one of his favorite things on his whole Southeast Asia trip, but due to tons of rain, and limited time I thought it’d be too difficult and time consuming to make it up to.  I figured I could kill two birds with one stone by doing a similar thing in Chiang Mai.  The experience was fun and cool, but not exactly how I had pictured it.  They were really big on safety, which is reassuring as you are hundred of feet up in the air and if you fell would instantly die, but also kind of sucks as the thrill of being up there in the trees is kind of lost when you are strapped in and out of harnesses and don’t really get to do much yourself.  There’s about 40 stretches of cable the longes one is 300 meters and is over an amazing sort of gorge where you can look out and see all the way to Chiang Mai.  Unfortunately it was raining and super cloudy so I couldn’t see anything but could imagine how amazing the view would be from up there in better weather.  Overall a positive experience but I probably wouldn’t recommend it to friends.  My guides were James Bond and Paul and were pretty hilarious characters.  Kicking it with them was probably the highlight of the day.  Like all the other guides I have met in Thailand they spent most of the day calling each other ladyboys which is analogous to American guys called each other “Homos”.  Good to see men are as immature in other countries as they are in America.[gallery]</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>Night travel has got to be one of the greatest things invented.  Not only are you transported while you sleep so you lose no time, you also don’t have to get a hotel for the night.  I spent less on the 2nd class sleeper car in my train than I did on my broke ass hotel the night before.  Additionally on both the night boat I took to Ko Tao, and the night train to Chang Mai, I met cool people.  What a great invention.  The sleeper trains in Thailand are amazingly nice.  Air conditioned (too cold actually bring warm clothes), super comfy and large beds, wall sockets for electricity, toilets, mirrors and sinks to wash up.  As many of you know I prefer couches to beds, this is basically my optimal living situation, and happens to be in a moving vehicle as well.</p>

<p>On the train there were two really cool French guys sitting across from me, Stephane and Majid.  I was curious as to where Majid was from as he looked similar to me but was French.  They gave me a little lesson on French history and explained that he was Algerian and what that meant in the context of France.  Learning something new every day.  Majid will be in Chang Mai about a week which is about what I will be there for so we made plans to go to Laos together.  Stayed up with them for a while just kicking it and exchanging stories about France vs. America and I tried to practice a little bit of my French.  Stephane was a news anchor for sports shows in France for many years and now he is doing TV production working on Polo currently and also used to (or still does?) do some journalism.  He was in Hong Kong for some meetings and then is taking a 2 week holiday, back to Hong Kong and then back to France.  Majid is an elementary school teacher who does half year teaching where you teach 6 months, then have 6 months off.  Sounds like a pretty awesome job, can I get that job?  He’s travelling for 4 months doing Thailand, then Bali, Sydney and I think one other place after that but I am blanking out.</p>

<p>The train should be arriving in Chang Mai shortly and I start my 3 day trek in about an hour.  Preity, the girl I met in Sydney will be joining me in Chang Mai when I return from my trek.

  <div class="entry-content"><p>When you go to Thailand everyone tells you not to go to Bangkok and the minute you arrive you understand why.  Bangkok is the epitome of a crowded dirty city.  It’s like all of the bad things about New York magnified and without any of the good things.  I managed to pick a hotel in the area that was analogous to the lower east side or east village 20 years ago.  It was really noisy, they blocked the street off and people were partying late.  A great place for a hotel.  The next day I woke up, read up on Burma visas and decided it was too much of a hassle and decided to go straight to Chang Mai.  I hopped in a tuk tuk who offered to drive me around the city to see the temples for 10 baht for 1 hour.  I was a little wary as it cost me 300 baht to get by taxi to my hotel and I had heard of many tuk tuk scams in Bangkok.  He told me the route we’d take which included a stop at the Transit Authority and I explained that I didn’t need to go there.  He explained to me that he gets free gas for bringing me there, so all I had to do was go in, pretend like I was interested and then tell them I’d think about it and leave with him.  This way we’d hit up the places I wanted to go, he’d take me to a few places that’d give him free gas and we both win.  I was so pleased with his honestly that I decided to help him out and offered to go to as many free gas places as he wanted as I didn’t have anything better to do and I hate the people who work at the TAT’s.  As an aside, I don’t know how many people have experience these types of places but each one I’ve been to the people are pushy and are liars.  Oh you must buy this hotel the one you want to go to is full.  How do you know it’s full you haven’t even called them to ask?  Oh no it’s high season very difficult to get room, must buy now. Etc etc.  These people are on my list right up there with lawyers and gov’t beaurocracies.</p>

<p>One of the places “John” my driver took me too was a suit shop.  He told me I had to go in for 10 minutes, act interested and he’d get his free gas.  However, once I got in there and started talking to the salesman, I realized I could get two cashmere suits custom tailored for around 500 USD and they’d even mail it to NYC.  I figured this was too good an opportunity to pass up so the haggling began.  I decided I wanted to get a vest with one of the suits and one summer suit and they threw in two custom tailored shirts.  All in all a pretty amazing deal.</p>

<p>The temples I saw had some really cool stuff.  The standing Buddha was enormous and pretty cool.  My favorite was Wat Saket.  The grand palace was pretty spectacular but it was 400 Baht to get in which seemed like a rip off so I skipped it.  My driver offered to take me to the train station if I would stop at another TAT which was right next to it which he promised was actually a good one and would give me the best prices.  He was right and they offered me prices about 75% lower than the other TAT’s had.  The guy was from New Zealand and I couldn’t place his accent and then I realized I rememberd it from Flight of the Conchords and realized where he was from.  He was the first guy that didn’t try to sell me anything.  I asked for a train ticket and he told me the cheapest and best train to get on.  I was so pleased by his straightforward manner that I wanted to give him some business so I booked a hotel and the 3 day 2 night hiking trek everyone had been hawking all day.  He was a photographer like myself (although probably a lot better).  We exchanged flickr profiles (check out his stuff www.flickr.com/photos/simionparisphotography ) and he told me about cool stuff to photograph in Chang Mai.  He even let me use their shower so I could get cleanup up before the 13 hour train ride.  What a great day.  [gallery]</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>I rushed to catch the ferry from Ko Tao to Ko Samui immediately after I finished my diving and it was a quick and pleasant ride.  Tons of people got off on Ko Pagnan for the full moon party but it didn’t sound even slightly appealing to me.  I went to the first beach bar I saw on Samui and used the internet to figure out a hotel and figure out where I was and relax with a beer.  I got a cab who promised to find me a hotel I would like for the right price for 300 baht.  Kinda pricey, but worth it.  I decided on the Hutcha Resort which was really nice, only 790 Baht and right on the beach.  I grabbed dinner and hit the sack early.  In the morning I woke up early so I could take pictures of the sunrise from the beach.  I was not disappointed.  The beach was gorgeous and the sunrise was amazing.  I also met an awesome dog, whose name I do not know as he was not wearing a tag, but I just named him Dawg.  We kicked it for a few hours on the beach taking pictures and fooling around in the rain and surf, it was a blast.  After that I booked a plane to Bangkok for that evening at 10, looked up an itinerary for the day, and rented a motorbike.  Cruising around the island by myself sans fellow travelers was great.  I could stop when/where I liked to take pics and didn’t have to worry about anyone else’s wants except my own.  The southern part of the island was spectacular.  I waded out into the water to get a bunch of great shots of the water, beaches and boats.  I visited Laem Sor Pagoda which was supposed to be a beautiful temple but turned out to be a pretty weak one.  Luckily I had had so much fun cruising around taking pictures that I was not disappointed at all.  I turned around and cruised back North to see the ice bar.</p>

<p>The ice bar has got to be one of the all time most gimmicky touristy things I’ve ever heard of, but I just couldn’t help myself.  It’s a bar in Chaweng beach that is -7 degress Celcius and completely made of ice.  It costs 375 baht just to go in and they give you a parka, gloves and fur hat.  The girls are dressed in furry white boots and school girl outfits and look amazing.  I got some cool pictures and bounced.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>Let me start in the middle because I am just so excited about this.  I rented a motorbike on Ko Samui and as I was heading home to catch my plane I heard gunshots and saw a shooting range to my left.  I hit the brakes and veered into the driveway to check it out.  I had the range to myself with the exception of the three Thai people who worked there who were shooting for fun while they were waiting for customers.  I picked the .45 because it was the gun I always see in the movies and they showed me how to load it while they laughed at me for not knowing how to do it.  If you’ve never shot a gun before I highly recommend it.  As sick as it sounds, holding a gun gives you an amazing feeling of power and when you shoot it it is such a release.  I was also pretty impressed with my targeting skills as I got a head, shoulder and heart shot on my first three.  Just another angry black man with a gun I guess….[gallery]</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>I love spontaneity, serendipity, random connections, loose ties, risk, randomness.  Most people I know are significantly more risk averse than myself.  However, most people also seem to always be fascinated by my appetite for risk and say they wish they could x,y,z.  In the movie The Game, the company CRS basically plans a random series of events that is crazy and thrilling for someone whose life is as non random and structured as could possibly be.  Is there a business here?  Would people pay to be surprised?  How can we create more loose ties?  I love playing the role of the connector, putting people together and creating synergies and inspiring people.  There&#8217;s something here I&#8217;m sure of it.  Thoughts friends?</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>Great quote from 50.  Seems like an obvious assertion but I&#8217;m not sure I&#8217;ve ever thought about this or heard anyone else say this.</p>

<p>The greatest fear people have is that of being themselves. They want to be 50 Cent or someone else. They do what everyone else does even if it doesn’t fit where and who they are. But you get nowhere that way; your energy is weak and no one pays attention to you. You’re running away from the one thing that you own—what makes you different. I lost that fear. And once I felt the power that I had by showing the world I didn’t care about being like other people, I could never go back.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>Hi friends.  The last few days have been pretty unbelievable.  I finished my PADI Open Water, Advanced Open Water and Nitrox certifications over the past 6 days.  Tomorrow I will be finishing my deep diving course which will certify me to dive up to the recreational dive maximum of 40 meters/130 feet.  I&#8217;ve done 10 dives over the past 4 dives and have loved each one.  I&#8217;ve learned peak performance buoyancy where they teach you to hover like buddha or hang upside down and generally float any way possible.  My instructor was this Japanese guy Kenji who was basically an underwater Samauri.  Hes done over 6,000 dives and his body is basically an extension of his will underwater.  He can even blow air bubble rings which at depth rise and expand into huge rings (pretty pimp skill).  Unfortunately it was too rough last night to do a night dive, so we did a wreck dive instead which was still pretty cool.</p>

<p>For anyone that&#8217;s never dove before, you should definitely think about getting certified, it&#8217;s a pretty amazing sport/hobby.  Also, if you&#8217;re going to do it, go to Ko Tao in Thailand.  It is hands down the best and cheapest place to get certified.  Crystal Divers is the resort I did it at and I would highly recommend them.  The instructors here have been great, both highly knowledgeable, really cool, and place a high premium on safety.  Lastly, because more people get certified on Ko Tao than anywhere in the world, it&#8217;s basically like an international party.  Everyone here is from somewhere different, and particularly the instructors and people doing there divemaster training here all are extremely interesting people.  I met a network engineer from Chicago who is 34 and decided one day he was done and left for Thailand to become a Scuba Diver.  I met two girls from Holland who are travelling the world while freelance writing for a magazine back in Holland.  They are currently writing an article about Asian men and the varying attitudes towards women which sounded fascinating.  The vibe on Ko Tao is super chill, friendly and international.  So many people come to do the open water and stay way longer.  Lots of people never leave; it is that kind of place.  Once you do your divemaster training here, you have free diving for life, so many people come back and kick it and dive.</p>

<p>One of the divemaster students I&#8217;ve been hanging out with&#8217;s name is Abrar.  He&#8217;s from Karachi in Pakistan and is 38.  He&#8217;s super chill and is nothing like what I would expect someone from Pakistan to be like.  He is not Muslim, and drinks although not excessively.  He quite his job in advertising 7 years ago and took his savings and started a production company.  Since then he has been making documentaries and reality adventure shows focusing on showing people what their potential is.  He&#8217;s been successful and has sold most of the shows to TV stations in Karachi.  He&#8217;s currently planning his next project which will take place most likely in Thailand and he is trying to sign Mountain Dew on as the branded sponsor.  He says he can produce the show for 200K and Mountain Dew is interested at 600K.  He says if he can do 5 or so shows over the next few years he&#8217;s done and will have achieved his dreams and is just going to travel for the rest of his life.  It was an inspiring story and I am going to keep him in my thoughts and try and send my positive thoughts towards things working out for him.  He&#8217;s also the one who took the underwater pic of me.  So many cool people here at the dive school, too little time.

  <div class="entry-content"><p>&#8220;Whatever happens, by the nature of simple probability it probably won’t be the worst thing that has ever happened to you or will happen to you.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;We never know it at the time, but you might be living the defining moment of your life right now. What would you do if it was?&#8221;</p>

<p>These two quotes I discovered on Taylor Davidson&#8217;s blog which I discovered in my search on the internet of people doing similar things to myself.  http://www.taylordavidson.com/writing/trip-2009/</p>

<p>I liked them so much I just had to share.  The first has been my mantra ever since losing my backpack in cancun with wallet and other various important items.  I lost my wallet in Bali a few weeks ago and didn&#8217;t even blink an eye.  Shit happens.  It&#8217;s almost certainly not the worst thing thats ever happened to you and there&#8217;s probably something worse happening to someone else at that exact moment.  Don&#8217;t sweat the small stuff, and even the stuff that seems major, probably isn&#8217;t in the context of your life.</p>

<p>The second I thought was great because everybody knows carpe diem, but this seems to be the question begged by carpe diem.  Assuming there was something to be seized right now, what would it be? Then go seize it!  As we say in Fort Greene, get after it.</p>
